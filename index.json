Keep an eye on your inbox for updates. Is there a right way to put a puzzle together? What about drafting a paper?\nWriting a paper or article is much like putting a jigsaw puzzle together, both are composed of many smaller pieces. And like a puzzle, it doesn’t matter how or where you start. What matters is that it gets done.\nThe jigsaw writing method is an approach to writing that encourages you to break the manuscript down into smaller sections or topics and start where you feel inspired\nHow does the jigsaw method work? After you’ve created an outline for your manuscript, pick a section or topic of the outline to begin drafting.\nWrite until you finish the section, your writing session, or run out of things to say.\nReview the outline and pick another place to begin writing.\nRinse and repeat until your writing session is over and/or you’ve completed your first draft.\nWhen should I use the jigsaw method for drafting? Whenever you feel inspired!\nPerhaps you’ve been mulling over the implications or limitations of your research. If so, it makes more sense to draft the relevant portion of the discussion instead of forcing yourself to start at the beginning or even where you left off last time.\nWhile the introduction is the first section of the outline, you don’t have to write it first. Drafting the methods or results is often a great place to get your brain working on a new manuscript.\nImportantly, the jigsaw method is fractal. That is, it scales to different levels of writing, from the introduction to the concluding paragraph of the introduction; wherever it is, start where you feel inspired.\nWhat about continuity and flow? Incorporating the jigsaw puzzle method into your writing process can prevent writer’s block that stems from restrictive approaches to drafting a manuscript. But can it affect the overall flow of the manuscript?\nIt’s possible that starting at different places in the manuscript at different times could make the flow disjointed. But that can also happen even if you write from start to finish because you may choose to change the order or logic during the revision process.\nFurthermore, it’s often easier to revise and rework the words that you have on the page than to get the words down in the first place. My suggestion is to get the words first and focus on the flow later.\nResources 7 Methods for Writing Your First Draft The introduction and full list of methods for writing the first manuscript draft.\n","date":1724850117,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724850117,"objectID":"84f38bb6259fc2fb9e4c05a540738553","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_jigsaw/","publishdate":"2024-08-28T09:01:57-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/draft_methods_jigsaw/","section":"post","summary":"In academic writing, the jigsaw method allows you to draft the components to your article in any order.","tags":["Writing","Drafting"],"title":"The 'Jigsaw' Method for Scientific Writing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ada K.

They will ruminate at length, letting the subconscious stay constantly engaged with the subject so that characters, plot and atmosphere form without any forced deliberation… The trick, I suppose, is knowing when to stop dreaming and get down to it.” - Ross Raisin\nFor many people there’s a period of time after researching and outlining a topic and before sitting down to write about it during which they simply think about it. Long or short, this invisible and intangible act is a perfectly valid part of the drafting process known as incubation or percolation time.\nHow does the incubation method work? How or when it works varies for each individual. Authors who use it will take time before any drafting begins to process and integrate their research into a coherent message.\nSome will draft an entire article or essay at a time. Others may compile smaller pieces like paragraphs or sentences between writing bouts.\nThe key to this method is finding time to actively think about your writing project without trying to also put words on the page.\nTo avoid the guilt of “doing nothing”, consider using repetitive tasks like washing dishes, walking, and driving to facilitate mind wandering and rumination on your topic without feeling unproductive. Be sure to keep a notepad or voice recorder nearby to collect any good thoughts! Then you can review them when it’s time to put pen to page.\nWhen should I use the incubation method? If you have a writing project that feels disconnected, disjointed, or otherwise unclear when you sit to work on it then you might benefit from some time away from your project. A week or even a couple of days can often provide the space necessary for your brain to process the material and find solutions.\nWhat about deadlines? In many cases, your project will have a deadline. Sometimes days but usually weeks or months away. Working backward from the deadline, create a timetable to identify when the first draft needs to be completed, and work in at least one week between ending your main research phase and beginning the drafting phase. That should be enough incubation time to mentally assimilate and organize your research. For shorter projects and deadlines, you may only need (or have available) a day or two.\nResources 7 Methods for Writing Your First Draft\nPercolation Time\nThe introduction and full list of methods for writing the first manuscript draft.\n","date":1724850109,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724850109,"objectID":"006f9b0c7476cc2390ddd4c60d9caf7a","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_incubation/","publishdate":"2024-08-28T09:01:49-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/draft_methods_incubation/","section":"post","summary":"The incubation method blocks out time between research and writing for your brain to process and begin drafting mentally before you begin physically.","tags":["Drafting"],"title":"The 'Incubation' Method for Scientific Writing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ada K.

That way, when you are ready to get started there’s no hunting for the things you need or worries that you’ve forgotten something.\nAs a bonus, having everything ready to go can also help prompt or encourage you to get started.\nA favorite method of Earnest Hemingway, that’s essentially what the set-up method for drafting is all about.\nHow does the set up method work? Stop a writing session when things are going well.\nLeave a paragraph, sentence, or even word(!) unfinished.\nNext writing session, re-read where you left off.\nStart writing by finishing what you started.\nStop while things are still going well.\nLike an informal writing prompt, this process can help get your writing juices flowing with little effort, breaking the inertia that often keeps a writing session from getting started.\nWhen should I use the set-up method? The set-up method pairs well with timed writing sessions, like the breaks during a Pomodoro or the end of a longer block. Instead of feeling frustrated that you have to stop when things are going well, you can use the set-up method to ensure that your next block of writing time begins efficiently.\nThis method may work well for people who tend to work until they hit burnout, exhausting themselves so much that they require days before their next writing block. Stopping early leaves a bit of gas in the tank, or words in the brain, which enables you to restart more easily than if you left it empty.\nWhile interesting, this method is a potentially tricky one to make work. People with ADHD (like myself) will likely have mixed results, depending on how well each project sticks in their brain between sessions.\nWhat if I forget between writing sessions? If you try out this method of drafting but find yourself forgetting where you wanted to go with your writing between sessions, try making some notes in the document before you close it. Either in bullets below where you’ve been working or in a comment off to the side, jot down a few essential points about what you wanted to cover next so that you have a reminder for next time.\nSee it at work It helps when I know what to write the next day. Yesterday, I outlined arguments in bullet points—today, I just explained, cited evidence, added analysis, and voila! Much easier than days when I have to start from scratch. #AcWri #AcademicSky #writing\n— Haleema Saadia (@haleemasaadia.bsky.social) Aug 25, 2024 at 1:59 AM Resources 7 Methods for Writing Your First Draft The introduction and full list of methods for writing the first manuscript draft.\n","date":1724850093,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724850093,"objectID":"5178b0746da78b0813975e4282c4beab","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_setup/","publishdate":"2024-08-28T09:01:33-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/draft_methods_setup/","section":"post","summary":"A favorite of Ernest Hemingway, this method of writing involves stopping before you're done.","tags":["Drafting"],"title":"The ‘Set Up’ Method for Scientific Writing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ada K.

Whether for a dissertation, thesis, or class research paper, a literature review may expose you to hundreds of research papers that could contribute to your understanding of the field and possibly even be cited in a manuscript. So how do you keep track of these sources?\nHere, I’ll describe three options for you to consider: keep an annotated bibliography, use spreadsheets, and use a citation management software.\nTip 1: Keep an Annotated Bibliography An annotated bibliography is going to be a list of the sources that you’ve read along with important notes to explain the source’s importance and relevance to your research. While some people do this by hand, that can be laborious, particularly when you are searching for a source after the fact. My suggestion for the modern annotated bibliography is to use a searchable format such as Word, Rmarkdown, OneNote, EndNote, etc. These options allow you to easily re-reference a source and (re)identify sources that talk about particular concepts. To maximize your annotated bibliography, there are several key components to include in each entry (and here’s a worksheet):\nCitation — In addition to the author(s) and year of publication, you should also make a note of the doi (so you can find it later using https://doi.org/[insert doi]), and the filename of the pdf. The filename is especially important since it allows you to find the pdf you already have, without opening 20 files one-by-one.\nMethods — Are any of the methods used especially relevant to your work? This might be because you need the protocol, they are key to interpreting the data, and/or are insufficient (i.e., they provide an opportunity for you to improve the field).\nResults — What are the key results and findings? What figure is central to their story?\nLimitations — What are the limitations of the research? What could be done differently to improve the robustness of the research?\nYour thoughts — What do you think about the paper? Use this as an opportunity to present your unfiltered thoughts, feelings, musings, and big ideas. That way you can find them later.\nFollow up — Are there any references that you should read in the future?\nTip 2: Keep a Spreadsheet Spreadsheets are another great option for keeping track of the sources you’ve identified in a searchable and easy to skim format. In this case, you would likely include more granular information about the source’s origins, citations, accessibility, etc. However, what you include may depend on how you plan to use the document.\nFor example, Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega uses a “Conceptual Synthesis Excel Dump”. In addition to basic citation information, Dr. Pacheco-Vega includes columns to capture his thoughts on each references as well as cross references and potential quotations. It’s very much like a horizontally organized annotated bibliography.\nFor a more basic compilation of sources, Eastern Washington University has a sample chart that you can use to build your own and Kathleen Clarke describes a slightly more intricate method that links spreadsheet entries to easy file identification. More visual, or more easily overwhelmed, writers might consider adding a color-coordination system to their spreadsheets.\nTip 3: Use a Citation Management System Citation management systems can be great tools for keeping track of relevant sources. I used to recommend Mendeley, however, it was put behind a paywall and underwent changes that make it more difficult to use and export your references if needed.\nThe open source (free) tool, Zotero is now one of the best options available for tracking and organizing sources. Not only does it have a browser extension to directly import references as you find them, it has an extensive reference and bibliography generation system. These can be easily formatted for text editors and used directly with Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs. Zotero also features some handy organization and collaboration tools.\nThe more visual academics might want to consider Diigo. With both free and paid options, this program features tools to tag, archive, annotate, organize, and even share your online research (much like Zotero does). The most innovative tool, however, is one that enables you to sort your sources into a structured outline, potentially allowing you to more easily identify weak or understudied parts of your research.\nResources What’s the Best Way to Organize My Research? | A librarian breaks down how to approach and organize your literature review process.\nOrganizing Your Literature: Spreadsheet Style | Describes an adaptable, nested spreadsheet organization system and how it can link to and help organize your file storage.\nTips for Organizing Sources for Research Papers | A basic review of the types of sources, …","date":1724630400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724630400,"objectID":"2ee4f00c9b59b5149487fa8a2e5f8752","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/organize_research/","publishdate":"2024-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/organize_research/","section":"post","summary":"A literature review for your dissertation or thesis might end with hundreds of research papers and just as many notes.

The scientific writing process can be summarized in five steps: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and finally… publication. It seems straightforward, but also… overwhelming. Especially when you’re tasked with starting at the beginning.\nThe good news is that while writing is a lot of work, it can be made more approachable. This post is the first in a series that will explore the writing process and break it down into actionable pieces, with an emphasis on writing in the biological and biosciences.\nWe’ll begin by describing the overall writing process and workflow.\nPrewriting - generate ideas, identify evidence and sources, and craft outlines\nDrafting - transform the outline into logically connected sentences and paragraphs, add evidence\nRevising - reorganize the draft, add evidence, eliminate tangents\nEditing - correct misspellings and grammar, check citations and figures\nPublication - submit for grading (or peer review)\nAnd so, the general process appears to be linear.\nWhat we think the writing process is like. Linear. But in practice, the effective writing process is quite a bit messier (image 2). For instance, after writing a first draft, the author often identifies topics that need more elaboration and/or evidence, which send them back through the prewriting and drafting steps. Even after a manuscript is done and submitted to a research advisor or reviewer, it often comes back with requests for revision. To accomplish those revisions, the author may need to revisit the prewriting and drafting steps again, followed by revising and editing for resubmission.\nA better representation of the writing process. Iterative. At first glance, the real writing process may seem even more overwhelming. After all, how are you supposed to know when to move forward or backward? How will you know when you’re done?\nThese are valid fears, and the beauty of an iterative writing process is that you don’t really have to answer them. Approaching writing as an iterative process, as opposed to linear, has multiple advantages. Some of these include:\nReduced pressure for first drafts,\nMore realistic writing expectations,\nMore accurate writing timeline, and\nHaving sections in different stages of the process allows for workload flexibility.\nScientific writing is an act of creativity that requires freedom to think, synthesize, and explore new ideas. Removing the pressure for the first draft to be perfect, or near perfect, allows you as a writer to start the writing process more creatively with bigger, messier ideas. As the ideas are refined, they might lead to unexpected connections and conclusions, but it’s hard to know unless they are given voice.\nAdditionally, because you begin the process knowing that prewriting, drafting, and revising will be revisited, there is less pressure for each step to be “complete” before moving on to the next. Set goals for the amount of time of words that you’ll spend on each step and when you’re done, start over. The more you write, the more accurate expectations you can develop for the time and effort spent at each step, leading to more accurate writing timelines.\nAn added bonus is that you can break down the writing task into smaller chunks, and work through the writing process for each individual section. If you have sections at varying stages (e.g., introduction is in prewriting, methods are in revising, discussion is in drafting), then you have freedom in the type of writing you will accomplish on any given day. Tired of putting words on the page? Read literature and work on prewriting the introduction. Mentally burnt out but still want to make progress? Add citations to the methods section.\n“ Writing is not a linear process, like following a recipe to bake a cake.” Teaching Elementary School Students to Be Effective Writers, Pg 14\nIf the demands of a linear writing process seem overwhelming to you. It’s understandable. Approaching writing as an iterative process may help overcome some of the mental obstacles in the way of your next writing task. This brief overview of the writing process will be followed by posts exploring each step in more detail and providing strategies to tackle them. For now, if your best laid writing plans aren’t working out, don’t feel alone. Writing is messy.

Sometimes it is like drilling rock and then blasting it out with charges.” — Earnest Hemmingway on Writing\nWriting when you have ADHD is particularly onerous. Sometimes you’ve been ruminating or feel inspired and the words just flow on to the page (much like this blog post). Other times just the thought of working on a writing assignment sends your brain into a tailspin. So how can you make progress when the deadline isn’t in two hours and getting words on the page feels like fishing barehanded?\nThis post contains 16 suggestions split into two sections:\n9 ideas for emergencies and 7 ideas for planning ahead to make consistent progress on large projects. Some of these are things that have worked for me, others are suggestions from other ADHD writers. Remember: your mileage may vary (depending on the project, your brain, hormones, etc).\nWriting Emergencies If you’re stuck and need help right now:\nAdapt the pomodoro — Set a timer for 20 minutes and try to type a few sentences (consider starting with the Freewrite Method if you need). Write extraneous thoughts on a spare sheet of paper to get them out of your head, which can help attempts to refocus. Once you get going, dispense with the timer except for when you STOP writing (bathroom, food breaks), then set it to remind yourself to get back to writing.\nPut your headphones in/on — If that doesn’t work, start a good playlist. I find that I prefer certain music when I’m writing, another when I’m coding, etc. Find the genere that feels inspiring and try to feed off of its energy to get started. Here are some of my favorites, most of which have no vocals.\nGo off grid — Turn off notifications, wifi, everything, then sit and stare at the page. If you aren’t writing, you aren’t doing anything else either so you might as well write.\nFind what’s possible — This is particularly helpful with larger writing projects that have multiple pieces in varying stages of completion. Maybe putting words on the page is impossible today but tackling comments from your advisor is doable. Revisions and edits are valid, important parts of the writing process, too.\nStart small — Identify the smallest, most specific writing goal(s) possible and frame it as a question. Answering that question may naturally lead into more. E.g., what are the characteristics of Bacillus anthracis? (Answer: B. anthracis is a gram positive, spore-forming bacterium. It is the causative agent of…)\nEmbrace stimulation — Find a mindless task (washing dishes, driving, folding laundry) and do it in silence instead of playing the radio, tv, or your phone. Think about what you’ve written so far and what you would like to write next. Think about your project until the words are itching to get on the page.\nHarness novelty — Go somewhere new to work, whether it be a coffee shop, library, or co-working space, find and control novelty in a place with the right amount of stimulation to let you focus on your writing.\nTry freewriting — This writing method can really help if your brain feels stuck since writing about what you’re having trouble with can help get you to what you’re supposed to be writing.\nGo for a walk — Letting ADHD bodies move often allows their brains the space to create. The problem is that you can’t walk and write at the same time. Or can you? Consider using Google Docs, a recorder app, or some form of dictation software to record yourself writing out loud as you walk. When you get back to the desk, transcribe/transfer it to your manuscript and now you have something to work with.\nTips for Writing Ahead If you’re thinking about how to make consistent progress on a project without leaving it to the last minute:\nRotate projects — Executive function isn’t exactly a strong suit for people with ADHD this may seem a counterintuitive suggestion, but consider maintaining multiple projects. Because our interest in a project can come in fits and bursts, having multiple projects that you can pick up and put down as your interest varies means that even if one seems impossible to tackle, you may have the brainspace or inspiration for another of your projects. Rotating through them can satisfy the need for novelty while maintaining momentum (and fostering incubation).\nBody double — Find an accountability buddy or group that you can co-work with, either in-person or online. People with ADHD tend to be socially motivated. Having another person trying to focus while you’re trying to focus can sometimes enhance your ability to focus!\nThe set-up method — Plan ahead and stop while things are flowing. Leave a word, sentence, or paragraph unwritten so that you know right where to start next time.

You know the words are there, you can see them, maybe even touch them. But as soon as you try to grasp them, they slip away.\nAt least, that’s what it seems like to me.\nI was only recently (within the last few years) diagnosed with ADHD. Of course, in hindsight, I can see it. I see the accommodations and coping mechanisms that I was fortunate enough to stumble upon, that allowed me to succeed. I see the missed opportunities, broken or neglected relationships, and unfulfilled promises. I also see the big ideas, dreams, creativity, and innovation that I often tried to pursue, with mixed results.\nWhen it comes to writing, I finally understand (at least a bit) why I struggled and why what worked, worked.\nWriter’s block was often the absence of novelty or an inability to organize my thoughts. Body doubling and shared workspaces curbed impulses and provided a degree of accountability. Caffeine calmed me. New places to write were a source of controlled novelty. I wish I could say that I’ve figured out all the tips and tricks to writing with ADHD, but I can’t. In fact, this post is one of my first, successful creative endeavors in the last 18 months because my brain has absolutely balked at writing. It’s a feeling that is nearly impossible to explain. I could do other things, like editing and data analysis, but not write. Not a good look for someone whose business is writing.\nIt’s been an exceedingly frustrating experience. But an enlightening one, I suppose, now that the dam has finally broken.\nI’ve finally realized that whatever’s happening in my brain, my approach to life, work, and writing is fundamentally different than most. And those differences have, and will continue to be, reflected in the way that I teach, talk, and write about academic writing. I’m now making the choice to be more cognizant and intentional about it.\nSo this post serves multiple functions:\nIt’s an expression of empathy and understanding for other ADHD/neurodivergent brains that need to write but just won’t. It’s a notice that I plan to add services and content geared to ADHD/neurodivergent writers. It’s a grain of salt applicable to all content and advice that I provide. And it’s a reminder that even if I stop posting here and/or on social media that I do (and Alliance does) still exist and am/will be happy to help however I can.

You write to get grants, publish papers, and get promoted. Academic institutions are aware of the necessity of writing, which is why many provide professional writing services at reduced, or no, cost. But undergrad heavy institutions can skew writer expertise toward term papers and reports; writing services may only be available to students, not postdocs or faculty; or perhaps the exact services that you need aren’t available.\nIn these situations, you may need to look outside of your institutional offerings to find a writing consultant or editors. And we aren’t cheap :/ ….\nThe good news is that many institutions and funding agencies have ways for you to pay for this help WITHOUT reaching into your own pocket. Below are examples of ways to access funding for writing help. It’s largely organized by academic position (trainee vs faculty).But broadly speaking, consultants (e.g., editors) are allowable costs for almost all research grants!\nTrainees (graduate students \u0026amp; postdocs) Many graduate and postdoctoral programs offer mini grants and similar funding mechanisms for professional development activities (e.g., Science Writing Labs, webinars)\nInstitutional seed grants and other small research grants usually consider consultants to be an allowable cost and will pay for help to either publish a paper or write another grant proposal (e.g., editing services)\nTraining grants, future independent research grants, and similar career grants often have a focus on professional development and will allow funds to be spent on such training activities. Some may only allow funds to be used for research grant proposal development; to be sure, check with the grant manager. See the “Faculty” section for more information on NIH trainee grants (e.g., NRSA, Ks).\nProfessional and scientific societies often have funds set aside for members to advance their careers. Check to see if yours have any mini grants for professional development available. Local and/or student chapters of such societies are also a good place to look for professional development funds. Remember, even if funds for individuals aren’t available, you can still ask about sponsored workshops or seminars. A couple of societies with professional development-related grants include:\nAmerican Society for Microbiology\nAmerican Association of University Women\nYour PI/research mentor may have access to two types of funding. Their start-up/discretionary fund, which generally has very few restrictions, and any research grants. See the “Faculty” section below for more detailed information about the costs allowed by most NIH \u0026amp; NSF grants. Internal/institutional grants will vary.\nSimilarly, many departments and/or programs have a pot of discretionary funds. Ask your chair or director if you can receive a one-time professional development grant. Alternately, ask if they would be willing to host a professional development workshop/webinar for department/program trainees.\nFaculty NIH Awards General Cost Consideration: 7.9 Professional Services Costs (i.e., Consultants)\n“Costs of professional and consultant services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill, and who are not officers or employees of the non-Federal entity, are allowable, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and which not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Federal government.\n“(b) The necessity of contracting for the service, considering the non-Federal entity’s capability in the particular area. (i.e., your needs can’t be fully met by existing institutional support)\n(c) The past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to Federal awards.”\nResearcher Career “K” Awards: Including: Institutional, Individual Mentors \u0026amp; Non-Mentored, \u0026amp; Career Transition\n12.8.3 Proposal Preparation Costs\n“Mentored CDA programs provide support with a goal of leading to research independence for an individual. Since research independence is achieved through applying for other research support, consistent with these objectives, it is allowable for effort devoted to proposal preparation costs for subsequent research support to be charged to a mentored CDA award. This can be considered part of the awarded effort commitment of the mentored CDA or an increase to that commitment with the allowable salary provided as applicable.”\nRuth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards: 11.2.9 Stipend and travel only.\nSupport of Scientific Meetings (Conference Grants): 14.10.1 “Consultant Services.

The writing process consists of several steps: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and publication. The outline is generated during the prewriting stage and, while necessary to describe the broad structure of an article, it is rarely revisited.\nThe outline drafting method, however, expands on the original outline to structure the drafting process.\nBeginning with the original outlining of the topic, major supporting topics, and key points, this drafting process gradually increases the level of detail for each section. This continues until every potential paragraph has been outlined to the appropriate degree of detail. All appropriate definitions, explanations, descriptions, evidence, or examples should be included along with any quotes that might be incorporated within the text.\nIntroduction\nThe writing process Prewriting Outline rarely revisited This method expands the outline Description\nIncrease the detail outline each paragraph Including more than facts rewrite in full sentences add transitions Conclusion\nHelps with short bursts of writing writer’s block almost exactly match the outline may require more transition revisions When as much detail has been added as possible, each fragment of the detailed outline is rewritten as a full, and complete sentence. Given that each sentence and paragraph will be drafted in isolation, the essential final step in the outline drafting method is to add the appropriate transitions between paragraphs and statements.\nIntroduction\nThe writing process consists of several steps: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and publication.

Accordingly, the refinery method of writing is drafting an article through multiple distinct versions, each of which has been altered from the previous version.\nThe first step of the refinery method is to write a complete draft of a section or blog post, start to finish. Don’t stress about how it begins, ends, or what happens in between. Once it’s written, read through it and note potential major changes.\nNext, open a fresh word document or get a fresh piece of paper and rewrite the entire draft. This time, incorporate the noted changes as you write. Again, read through the freshly completed draft and note any major changes that you might like to make.\nIn (or on) a fresh document, again rewrite the entire draft. Once completed, again read and note any major changes. These steps can be completed any number of times, until the overall structure of the draft is satisfactory.\nThe refinery method is generally used when writing fiction, however, it can also be adapted to academic and/or scientific writing. I suggest using it when the overall structure or narrative doesn’t seem readily apparent. Getting the words onto paper in the order that comes most naturally enables their order and suitability to be evaluated.\nReferences 7 Methods for Writing Your First Draft https://lithub.com/7-methods-for-writing-your-first-draft/\nThe introduction and full list of methods for writing the first manuscript draft.\n","date":1639267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639267200,"objectID":"b52d29f2b45e72aedc8953db555abda8","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_refinery/","publishdate":"2021-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/draft_methods_refinery/","section":"post","summary":"The refinery method is a good strategy when the overall structure or narrative of science writing doesn’t seem readily apparent.","tags":["Writing","Drafting"],"title":"The 'Refinery' Method for Scientific Writing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ada K.

Despite the importance of pre-writing warm ups, we can’t always make it happen. Perhaps we were too preoccupied with another problem to focus during the warm up period. Or maybe a meeting ran over and we had to rush between tasks, skipping the warm up altogether.\nIn any case, if you sit down to write and your mind is blank, try the freewrite method.\nFreewriting is a stream of consciousness method that can help direct your mind to the task at hand. Here’s how it works:\nSit down with an open word document.\nStart typing anything that comes to mind.\nContinue typing, and remind yourself what your writing task is.\nKeep typing everything that goes through your mind.\nEventually this mental conversation will transition entirely to the writing task at hand. It might look pretty messy, and later you’ll need to delete the extraneous text. If successful, however, you’ve added words to your draft, and that is what’s important.\nIn practice, it might look something like this:\nUgh, ok, it’s 7:30 in the morning and I’m tired but I really need to finish this writing blog. I think I’m supposed to be writing about the freewriting method, which is a method that I advocate for a lot. There’s something helpful about being able to type without worrying about what goes on the page. Anyway, so how it works is that you just sit down and start typing, and typing, and typing to see what comes out. Eventually, you can get your brain warmed up and focused on the writing task at hand.\nGranted, freewriting about the freewriting method is a bit… unusual, but hopefully you’ve gotten the point.\nI think I’ve recommended the freewriting method to nearly everyone who has told me that they need to write something, but they don’t know what to write. The beautiful part about freewriting is that it truely, does not matter what goes on the page, especially in the beginning. And even after you’ve warmed up to the topic, you can continue to write in a stream of consciousness.\nFreewriting gives you the freedom to write whatever you want about your topic, in whatever order or phrasing makes sense to you.\nI can almost guarantee that if you’ve done your literature review and are at the point to generate a first draft, the freewriting method can get at least 70 to 80% of your content on the page. Again, yes, it will be messy writing and you’ll need to clean it up, maybe reorganize, rephrase, and refine to fit the flow of the outline. But the essential information will be there for you to revise, which was the initial goal.\nTo recap:\nFreewriting is a warm-up method that can also be applied to the drafting process.\nThe introduction and full list of methods for writing the first manuscript draft.\n","date":1625616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625616000,"objectID":"13d2a3f796dece81f4e7baac3c2bc1bb","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_freewrite/","publishdate":"2021-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/draft_methods_freewrite/","section":"post","summary":"Freewriting is a stream of consciousness writing warm-up that can also be applied to the drafting process.","tags":["Writing","Drafting"],"title":"The 'Freewrite' Method for Scientific Writing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ada K.

Whether or not your brain has been adequately warmed up with a writing warm up and is ready to transition to writing, it always helps to have an external, perhaps physical, cue that it is time to write.\nThe exact ritual will, of course, vary from person to person. It can also vary according to the type of writing task as the mental state and process for writing a letter of recommendation or grant is necessarily different from that of drafting a manuscript.\nMy preference is to make a hot cup of coffee or tea before I sit down to write. The process of making the drink, along with the soothing comfort of holding a hot mug, help me to relax and shift my focus to writing. Other rituals can be a bit more… extreme, like the famous authors who reportedly sleep next to their manuscript, or hang upside down in anti-gravity boots.\nIf you don’t already have a pre-writing ritual or habit, create one.

When was the last time you tried to run, I don’t know, a mile?\nIt was back in 2015 for me. So I know that if I tried to get up a run a mile right now, it would NOT go well. If I did finish, it would be done slowly; it doesn’t make sense for me to expect anything different. If I trained for it every day, though, then I could expect to quickly run a mile next month.\nWhen was the last time you wrote for more than 20 minutes in a single sitting? Or sat down to write at all?\nWhy Writing Warm Ups (and Exercise) are Essential If you’re like me, you only do it when you have to. And since your brain is like a muscle, it doesn’t adjust well to different and larger-than-normal tasks: like writing that first 3,000 word paper or the yearly grant. Binge writing — writing only when a large task needs to be completed immediately — leaves you mentally exhausted and requires days, if not longer, to recover from. Before long, you begin to hate the idea of writing, which leads to further procrastination and a never ending cycle of binge writing and writing hangovers.\nAnother difficult (and unfair) ask for muscles are rapid transitions between tasks. An athlete doesn’t sit on the couch then compete with cold muscles; they do a warm up first, mimicking the activity they’re about to perform, which prepares their muscles for strenuous activity. Warm ups enhance muscle performance and prevent injury.\nSimilarly, it’s unfair to expect an academic to immediately transition from demanding bench work to writing on a grant. The brain needs a warm up, too. Enhanced performance in writing means time saved, and while brain injury is unlikely, do you really want to give yourself another reason to avoid writing?\nTo be clear, academics are expecting too much of themselves when they: (i) Binge write (i.e., run a mile without training), and (ii) Write cold (i.e., skip a warm up activity).\nWhat’s a Writing Warm Up? First, let’s talk about what a writing warm up is not. It’s not:\nAnother task that you need to fit into your day,\nParticularly complicated, or\nOptional for a smooth transition to writing.\nIt is a thought process that requires some planning.\nAt its core, a writing warm up is using a low cognition task to create a mental buffer, or transition period, between one cognitively demanding task and another (e.g., tricky experiments and writing, or data analysis and writing). The exact low cognition task will vary from person to person and day to day, but it must fit one criterion: it only uses muscle memory.\nPerforming a low cognition task (e.g., walking, driving, washing dishes, or folding clothes) before you write allows you to begin thinking about your writing task.\nSpending this five to ten minutes (or more) thinking about what you are going to write before you write it is your writing warm up. This process cognitively transitions yourself for a productive writing session. I say it takes planning because it will take effort to identify a suitable warm up task, and remember to avoid it until immediately before your writing session. It also takes some effort to avoid mental distractions during the warm up. Writing warm ups are an essential part of my writing process now. It is satisfying to open a writing project and immediately begin typing because the words are ready and waiting.\nHow Do You Practice Writing? Well, like anything else, you just do it. A lot. I’m not going to dwell here because it is just like physical exercise; find a writing task and start with 20 minute sessions. For the days that you don’t have an essential writing task lined up, blogging, science-related Wikipedia entries, and/or writing prompts can help keep your skills honed between essential writing tasks.\nThe Bottom Line: (i) Warm up with a low cognitive task that allows you to mentally transition to writing. (ii) Exercise your writing “muscles” frequently with at least 3, 20 minute sessions per week.\nThe introduction and full list of methods for writing the first manuscript draft.\nMore Ideas for Writing Warmups and Exercise\nWomen Scientists Wikiproject\nWikiProject Science\nScientific Society Volunteer Blogs (e.g., American Society for Microbiology, American Physiological Society)\nMassive Science\nScience Connected\n","date":1624233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624233600,"objectID":"a2d72edbab2bb94c01a893365b18684b","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_warm_up/","publishdate":"2021-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/draft_methods_warm_up/","section":"post","summary":"An athlete doesn’t sit on the couch then compete with cold muscles; they do a warm up first to prepare their muscles for strenuous activity.

Probably one of the most frustrating parts of the scientific writing process is actually getting words to paper, aka “the first draft”.\nIt’s not uncommon (for me, anyway) that after finding the time and having the energy to put words to paper, they fail to present themselves. It’s a frustrating feeling that can lead to doubting myself as both a writer and an academic.\nI forget that the brain is like a muscle and that writing is a skill. Even the most skilled track and field athletes warm up differently to run the 100 meter dash than to throw the javelin. Furthermore, being skilled at both events requires an athlete to learn and apply two different sets of techniques.\nA similar concept applies to being an academic and/or scientist.\nDesigning experiments, conducting experiments, and writing a manuscript are all essential skill sets that require distinct techniques.\nThis is the beginning of a blog series that will explore and describe several methods and techniques (below) for approaching the drafting process. Some of these may work as “warm ups’’ to transition your brain to the writing process. Others will be techniques to be employed directly in the drafting step. None are meant to be mutually exclusive.\nThe goal of this series is to provide academic writers, like yourself, with tools to personalize and improve the writing process.\nI encourage you to experiment with them, find what works for you, and then tell me about it (find me on LinkedIn or Bluesky). What worked? What didn’t work? Why not?

Deciding what to write about is generally pretty easy for a researcher. Here’s my research topic. Read. Take notes. Write the manuscript. But approaching the prewriting and drafting stages of the writing process that way can waste precious time and energy, so here are a couple of things you can do to focus your prewriting.\nPrewriting is the first step in your journey to a manuscript or review paper. It precedes the drafting stage and is the step that will likely take the longest. During prewriting you:\nDecide what you’re going to write about,\nMake an outline of your paper, and\nResearch and take notes, aka “review the literature”.\nWhile it may seem straightforward (albeit overwhelming), the prewriting process is crucial to all following steps of the writing process. A haphazard approach to prewriting can result in:\nNon-essential research,\nDisorganized writing full of tangents, and\nA longer/more difficult revision process.\nAll of which add up to lost time and energy.\nThat means you need a solid prewriting strategy, which is determined in the first (seemingly shortest) action of the writing process: deciding your topic.\nHere are two tips to focus your ideas during step one of prewriting.\nIdentify the central message. The central message is one or two sentences that identify what you want your reader to know when they are done reading your scientific text. Since these are for planning purposes, they are often jargon heavy and don’t make it into your article intact. Instead, the central message helps guide you, the author, in identifying key information that needs to be included in your outline and literature review.\nFor instance, my dissertation work studied how the bacterium Bacillus anthracis gathered iron using a small molecule called a siderophore. Siderophores are exported and used to scavenge insoluble iron from the environment. One of the siderophores that B. anthracis uses is called petrobactin. So, when I was planning my dissertation defense the central message for my talk was:\n“Petrobactin is required for rapid sporulation by B. anthracis and is exported by ApeX, but petrobactin fragments can support B. anthracis disease.”\nAgain, this is jargon heavy and did not become an explicit sentence in my defense. However, it narrows down the information that will be included. For instance, if I’m discussing petrobactin use by B. anthracis, then I don’t need to discuss other bacteria that may use petrobactin (which is important information for a review paper about petrobactin). Additionally, if I’m focusing on the role of petrobactin in sporulation, then I can keep my discussion of spore germination to a minimum.\nIdentify your scientific narrative. The narrative is going to be the overarching structure of your paper. Like the central message, this is jargon heavy and will not be directly included in the body of your paper. However, it helps further guide you in determining the information that needs to be included and what information or concepts are tangential. The most generalized narrative structure was characterized by Randy Olson in his book Houston, We Have a Narrative. Here, Olson describes the ABT narrative structure, which is:\nAnd, But, Therefore.\nWhile it appears unassuming, the ABT narrative has a lot to offer scientists. There’s too much to cover in this blog post, so here’s an overview (an ABT workshop will be offered in the future). Most stories can be crafted with a single ABT wherein the AND lays the background information and context, the BUT introduces a conflict or something unexpected, and the THEREFORE describes a solution or conclusion.\nFor example, this article was drafted from a brief ABT narrative:\nA - What is prewriting AND what steps are generally included in the first stage,\nB - BUT a poor prewriting strategy can cause problems,\nT - THEREFORE, here are two key concepts (central message and ABT) to guide the author through the writing process more efficiently.\nIf you look back at the overall structure of this blog post, you can see how my ABT forms the skeleton of the writing. Similarly, the ABT helps inform my overall outline, as well as what information is relevant or not. In the ABT, I’ve committed myself to tips that make prewriting more effective for an organized draft. That means I’m not discussing how to manage references. While that’s important and easily locating your references makes adding citations more efficient, it doesn’t directly contribute to the organization of your writing.\nHowever, each science story, or manuscript, requires two distinct narrative ABTs. The first is the Question ABT, which generally provides the skeleton of the introduction, rationale, and methodology of the study. The second is the Answer ABT, which describes and …","date":1592092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592092800,"objectID":"e6c6083bea217be0b511677098f81ec1","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/central_message_narrative/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/central_message_narrative/","section":"post","summary":"To prevent disorganized writing and non-essential research, use your central message and narrative for a solid prewriting strategy.","tags":["Science Stories","Writing","Narrative","Process"],"title":"Identify the Story to Make Your Writing Process More Effective","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ada K.

When it comes to a literature review for thesis and article writing, everyone has the same three questions.\nWhere do I start? When do I stop? How do I stay organized? Today, we’ll cover some tips for answering the first two questions. Next week’s post will address organizing sources.\nWhere do I start the lit review? The big picture - It’s important to first get a sense of the overall field, and where you’ll begin with this depends on your level of experience in the field. If you are completely new to the field, then beginning with a relevant Wikipedia article may be right for you. Like academic literature, Wikipedia entries have references which can point you to relevant articles in the literature. However, if you’re familiar with the field and haven’t done an in depth literature review in it yet, then reading both a dated (at least 5 to 10 years old) and a recent (in the last 1 to 2 years) review article can help you understand the overall progress of the field and identify important articles and themes. Finally, those with high experience and knowledge in the field may choose to begin by reviewing the most recent publications using Google Scholar or a similar source.\nWhere to begin a literature review, according to your experience in the field. The outline - Before you begin the literature review, you should have developed an outline. Now that you have an understanding of the big picture, re-evaluate the outline for missing pieces, logical flow, and potential redundancies. If things seem overwhelming, pick a topic or subtopic to begin your research at. You could either ease into the process by choosing a topic you know fairly well, or pick the area where you are the weakest and know you will need to spend the most time.\nWhen do I stop reading and start writing? Set a deadline - Consider allocating a specific amount of time to the initial research stage of your writing process. This may help you be more efficient with your research time and gives a non-negotiable deadline to start putting words to paper.\nKeep track - Keep a log or journal where you note the search terms and databases that you have used to find sources. Have you exhausted your options? If so, consider asking a colleague or your advisor if they have additional suggestions for search terms and/or resources. If not, or you feel confident with your search thus far, then it might be time to start your first draft.\nUpdate your outline - The outline should help guide your reading and information gathering, and should be updated as you work through each topic and subtopic. When each section seems to have a reasonable number of points, then you probably have enough information for the first draft.\nCheck your mental load - Sometimes you will come across a new piece of information or perspective that will shift your thought process. Sometimes there will be so much information in your head that there doesn’t seem to be room for any more. Any time there are thoughts that seem to be swirling, then it’s time to put them to paper. Maybe this means that after spending a few days on a subtopic your brain feels overwhelmed, so you stop and draft a few paragraphs before you move on to the next. Or maybe you’ll research 50% or 90%, or even 100%, of the outline before this happens and you stop for a few days to get all of the information out of your head and onto paper. Either way, figuring out what works for you will give you a better idea of when it’s time to stop reading and start writing.\nDon’t stress - Remember that writing is iterative so you can always (and probably will) come back to the research stage later.\nResources LibGuides: Literature Review: Conducting \u0026amp; Writing\nThe Literature Review | A Complete Step-by-Step Guide - Good tips for review papers\n","date":1590537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590537600,"objectID":"a3ab3533bdf4c150840d77ded6391078","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/post/when_to_stop/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/when_to_stop/","section":"post","summary":"When it comes to a literature review for thesis and article writing, everyone has the same questions: Where do I start and when do I stop?

The next step in the prewriting process is the outline, but what is it and why should you make one?\nAt this point, you should have your topic, central message, and narrative. You will build on those to create an outline, the next layer in organizing your paper before you begin to write. But aside from personal preference, why create an outline at all?\nTo save yourself time and effort. The outline serves several purposes that all contribute to reducing the amount of revision your first draft will need.\n1. Reduce mental load.\nAt this point, there are probably a lot of bits and pieces of your paper that are floating around in your head. The outline is a perfect place to keep these for future use. Getting them out and onto paper frees up a lot of brainspace, which you’ll need for the research stage of prewriting. Additionally, the bullet point format will demonstrate the areas where you either have, or lack, expertise. And now you have a handy structure to add information to during your literature review to help track your progress .\n2. Improve organization.\nThe bullet point format is also helpful for preempting repetitive information and making connections between topics to improve the overall flow of your manuscript. By outlining each section and their paragraphs first, you can ensure that each paragraph is essential in advancing your narrative and more easily identify (and rearrange) related information or logical connections to aid topic transitions. If you’re feeling stuck, there are outline prompts and resources at the bottom of the page.\n3. Ensure advisor compatibility.\nIt can feel pretty defeating to write a 4,000 word first draft that your advisor either completely rearranges or scraps. Avoid that frustration for both you and your advisor by presenting them with a detailed outline. Going over the outline with your advisor can help eliminate potential problems by identifying areas that will need to be expanded, moved, or eliminated all together. Working with your advisor on the outline will also give both of you confidence in the drafting process, since you both have an understanding of what will be discussed and the order. To get the most out of the discussion, consider waiting until you have a more detailed post-literature review.\nRemember, the writing process is messy, so your first outline won’t be perfect. Instead, much like your final product, it will be in constant flux until you’ve moved past the revision stage.

Exposure to and consumption of that water through October 2015—when the water source was switched back—has led to learning and developmental delays and correlates with decreased fertility. The water switch is now linked to deaths caused by the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila.\nLegionella are gram-negative bacteria found throughout nature, where they infect amoebae. However, they can also live in built environments, such as reservoirs and water towers, where they form persistent biofilms from which bacteria are dispersed. When the water is used, people are exposed to the bacteria by inhaling aerosolized water droplets like those produced by showers and sprinkler systems.\nOnce in the lungs, legionellae can cause the infection known as Legionnaires’ disease. The bacteria invade and replicate in lung macrophages, which provide a replication environment similar to that in their amoebae hosts. Unchecked, the infection leads to pneumonia and a 10-30% chance of death, primarily in those with compromised immune systems, including those over 50 and current or former smokers.\nAlthough at least 24 species of Legionella are associated with human disease, about 90% of Legionnaires’ cases are caused by Legionella pneumophila. This is the organism that University of Michigan professor and ASM President Elect Michele Swanson researches. Her work has focused on how legionellae replicate inside macrophages, evade degradation, and, more recently, persist in the environment.\nBoth Swanson’s expertise in legionellae and proximity to Flint meant she was ready and able to join a multidisciplinary team created to study the effects of changes in the Flint water source on public health. This research group, the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership (FACHEP), also includes researchers from the Henry Ford Health System, Michigan State University, Colorado State University, the MADE Institute, Genesee Health Systems, and Kettering University. FACHEP was created in January 2016, when Michigan Governor Rick Snyder organized a $3.35-million contract with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Wayne State University to fund the collaboration.\nBefore the Flint water crisis, there were 6 to 12 Legionnaires’ disease cases in a typical year in the Flint area. When Flint’s source water was switched to the Flint River, there were 45 cases per year in 2014 and 2015. Nick Lyons, the former director of MDHHS, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to respond to the Flint Legionnaires’ outbreak for more than a year, while the Chief Medical Executive, Dr. Eden Wells, has been charged with obstruction of justice. Wells has also been accused of interfering with research conducted by the FACHEP group. If the MDHHS can show that the outbreak was limited to patients and visitors to the McLaren hospital in Flint (which has been plagued by hospital-associated Legionnaires’ disease), then a guilty verdict might be avoided. However, FACHEP’s recently published research doesn’t support the hypothesis of the MDHHS, who despite providing funding for the FACHEP, disputes the findings from both papers. That funding will no longer be available following a contract dispute and was announced the day following publication of Zahran et. al in PNAS.\nFigure 1. Chlorine levels before, during, and after the switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River (used with permission from source, figure 1b). Zahran et. al, compared cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Flint and surrounding areas over a six-year period (before, during, and after the Flint water switch) to chlorine levels at multiple locations in the city, and found compelling correlations. Before the water source was switched to the Flint River, chlorine levels at all eight locations clustered together with levels ranging between 0.2 and 1 mg/L. However, after the switch to Flint River water, the chlorine levels went haywire and fluctuated wildly between locations, ranging from almost 0 to 2.5 mg/liter (Figure 1). Levels restabilized after the water source was switched back to Lake Huron.\nFigure 2. The probability of Legionnaires’ disease as a function of chlorine levels. (used with permission from source, figure 3) When the researchers plotted the probability of Legionnaires’ disease against Cl$_2$ levels they found that the chlorine concentration was predictive of disease occurrence. For chlorine to act as an effective disinfectant, it must be present as Cl$_2$ in levels of at least 0.2 mg/liter and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 0.5 mg/liter. The odds of a person in Flint contracting Legionnaires’ disease increased by nearly threefold when the average weekly chlorine …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"01342300bd7661a8f8b2a39104820da0","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/project/examining_flint/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/examining_flint/","section":"project","summary":"Why did cases of Legionnaires’ disease spike when the water source was changed for Flint, Michigan?

Is your urine sterile? And do bacterial cells outnumber your own cells 10:1? These were some of the persistent microbial myths addressed in the video, “Microbial Myths.” Dr. Michael Schmidt and I began the discussion with some ASM history, after which Dr. Michael Schmidt explained the facts behind the 5-second rule and addressed other questions in depth. We followed this with a lightning round for short answers on some big questions, and the session wrapped with Dr. Schmidt on the spot as he accepted questions from the live audience at ASM Microbe 2018 in Atlanta, Ga.\nThe lightning round was fun but fast, and didn’t allow in-depth answers to a complex question, nor did we have time to address all of the questions from the audience. Let’s dive into the studies surrounding those questions here.\nYou can sanitize your sponge in the microwave. Verdict: MYTH Kitchen sponges are the perfect breeding ground for bacteria: they’re warm and moist after use; they’re covered in pores that trap water and provide surfaces for bacteria to replicate; they come in contact with contaminated surfaces (like moldy food dishes and chicken-laden cutting boards), and they’re used for weeks or months at a time. This perfect storm makes it no surprise that sponges harbor more bacteria than anywhere else tested in the average home.\nSeveral products and techniques claim to sanitize your kitchen sponges, so they can be “safely” reused. For instance, a Google search for “ways to sanitize a sponge” brought up websites suggested microwaving, vinegar, and bleach as some of the most prevalent DIY techniques to extend the lifespan of a sponge. But do these techniques work?\nFigure 1. A) Microscopic image of bacteria fluorescing on a sponge (red) B) Surface of the sponge (blue) C) Overlay of fluorescent bacteria and sponge. D) 3-D rendering of bacteria (red) on the surface of a sponge (blue) (Scale bar = 10µm). Source. While studying the types of bacteria commonly found on sponges, a 2017 study touched on this question. Using microscopy techniques, the researchers visualized bacteria growing inside the pores of 14 used kitchen sponges and found high bacterial counts (~10^7^ to 10^9^ cfus per sponge). DNA sequencing showed that about 36% of the bacteria on sponges belonged to the family Moraxellaceae, which is a common member of the skin microbiome. Other prevalent taxa were Pseudomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. Some taxa, such as Xanthomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, varied according to the sponge tested, which might reflect the habits and food choices of the previous owners. Another study also found Bacillus and Micrococcus to be prevalent on kitchen sponges. Potentially pathogenic bacteria seem to comprise only a small portion of the bacteria found on a sponge.\nCan sanitizing your sponge eliminate these bacteria? In the 2017 study above, previous owners of some of the collected sponges reported to have “cleaned” their sponges regularly (either microwaving or rinsing with hot water). Despite cleaning, these sponges contained the same number of bacteria as non-sanitized sponges, but the makeup of the bacterial communities differed. Sponge sanitation clearly doesn’t kill all of the bacteria present on a sponge, and any surviving bacteria can quickly take over sponge real estate. This is due to the high numbers of bacteria that colonize the sponge surface: even if microwaving were to kill 99.9% of 10^7^ bacteria, almost 10,000 are still alive!\nInstead of sanitizing the sponge, microwaving or using other techniques may predispose a sponge to harboring heartier bacterial species. Your best bet is to rinse the sponge daily and replace it all together on a weekly basis or after wiping up raw egg or meat. If you’re concerned about the environmental impact of this suggestion, consider purchasing dye-free, biodegradable sponges or using dishrags that can be frequently washed and dried.\nDelaying baby’s first bath helps establish the skin microbiome. Verdict: Probably TRUE Newborn babies are covered with vernix caseosa, a thick Vaseline-like layer that protects their fragile skin from moisture in utero and contains antibacterial enzymes such as lysozyme. On top of this, the birthing process coats newborns in blood and other bodily fluids, which might be contaminated with blood borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis C. These fluids, along with the vernix, are wiped away following birth and the newborn is bathed as soon as possible, in part to protect hospital staff from blood borne pathogens. The World Health Organization suggests that baby’s first bath should be postponed for 24 hours to prevent hypothermia, but many U.S. hospitals bathe the infant around eight hours post-birth unless the parents request otherwise. The life-threatening issue of hypothermia has guided much of the research and recommendations for infant bathing thus far.

But is there a way to take what we’ve learned about these essential molecules and use them to turn the tide against the wave of antibacterial resistance? Researchers are developing sideromycins, inhibitors and vaccines to turn siderophores against their makers.\nSideromycins To get an edge in survival against competing bacterial species, some bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces spp.) make sideromycins, siderophores conjugated with an antibiotic molecule. Sideromycins look like siderophores to other species of bacteria, which import them for their iron payload. But by bringing sideromycins in, the bacteria inadvertently poison themselves with the attached antibiotic. Researchers have caught onto this trick and designed their own sideromycins to target bacterial pathogens. This is important work since antibacterial resistance is at an all-time high and the number of effective antibiotics is decreasing. Since most resistance mechanisms rely on keeping the antibiotics out, the Trojan Horse sideromycins might help antibiotics bypass these and target specific pathogens.\nThis is what researchers at the University of Notre Dame had in mind when they designed a sideromycin against the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The authors conjugated the antibiotic daptomycin to the A. baumannii siderophore called fimsbactin and effectively treated infected mice. This is especially exciting because daptomycin is traditionally only effective against gram-positive bacteria, but by conjugating it to fimsbactin, they could use it to treat the gram-negative A. baumannii, but not others (e.g., E. coli, Pseudomonas). Other groups have generated sideromycins against Staphylococcus aureus, Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and even A. baumannii, but this report is the first to show that the drugs can work in a mouse infection model. And unfortunately, it is possible for mechanisms to prevent sideromycin import to evolve, thus creating resistance against sideromycins.\nInhibitors Another way to co-opt our knowledge of siderophores is to generate new antibiotics that target siderophores and prevent their production or use by pathogens. There are two common pathways for siderophore biosynthesis in bacteria, and researchers have taken advantage of these similarities to identify small molecules that interact with and inhibit siderophore biosynthesis enzymes. In some cases, researchers use rational design to generate these small molecules. By taking what they know about the structure of the enzymes and how they function, researchers can generate small molecules that they think will act as inhibitors. Two 2005 studies described how researchers targeted an early step in siderophore biosynthesis by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One group designed molecules that interfered with a biosynthetic protein’s ability to bind ATP, while the other targeted the ligand binding site of a biosynthetic protein and was also able to inhibit siderophore biosynthesis by Yersinia pestis. More recently, Dr. David Sherman’s lab at the University of Michigan screened a library of naturally occurring small molecules for their ability to inhibit siderophore biosynthesis in Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus. In all of these cases, the identified molecules inhibited growth of the pathogen in a test tube, but none have been tested in a mouse model of infection.\nVaccines The best way to fight an infection is by preventing it from happening at all. With that in mind, Dr. Harry Mobley’s lab at the University of Michigan has been exploring siderophore-based vaccines against urinary tract infections. Initially, they tried to target the immune response against select siderophore receptors on the cell surface of urinary pathogenic E. coli (UPEC). With this method, they successfully vaccinated mice against the receptor for yersiniabactin and generate a protective immune response. But those proteins are unwieldy and difficult to purify for regular use in a vaccine. What about targeting the siderophore itself?\nGenerating protective vaccines that target siderophores has been considered a risky prospect since the molecules are so small and don’t seem to elicit immune responses. While a 2009 study demonstrated it was possible to generate antibodies against a siderophore (in this case vibriobactin), they didn’t show a protective immune response. But two papers published side-by-side in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year showed how researchers have accomplished targeting the mouse immune response against siderophores. One study from the Mobley lab described their continued efforts to generate a vaccine against UPEC. Here, they conjugated the siderophores aerobactin and yersiniabactin to cationized bovine serum …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"93a47c77b94fc2931a27e4cc9ddef89b","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/project/siderophore_treatment_target/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/siderophore_treatment_target/","section":"project","summary":"Iron is essential for many bacterial pathogens to cause disease so they often use siderophores to gather it.

But siderophores can do double duty, with functions in survival, attack, and signalling, making these molecules bacterial Swiss Army knives.\nSurvival Figure 1. Part of the periodic table highlighting some of the elements shown to be bound by siderophores. Those highlighted in green (Mn, Fe, Zn) are essential for growth and those in yellow (B, Si, Cu) are helpful for survival or signaling. Source. [Fig]The affinity of siderophores for iron occurs along a spectrum from high to low, and where a siderophore falls on this spectrum can alter their potential to bind other elements. In the last siderophore post, we learned that siderophores can import essential nutrients other than iron like manganese or zinc. But siderophores can also bind non-essential nutrients, as occurs with the silicon-binding enterobactin found in the root system of a Cameroonian medicinal plant. This silicon-binding ability doesn’t seem to benefit the producing Streptomyces species, but likely acts as a cooperative molecule that provides the silicon its plant host requires.\nSome siderophores can also bind copper, not for growth, but for survival by decreasing toxic quantities to manageable ones. Copper is toxic to bacteria, capable of killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within 90 minutes (they can survive 72 hours on stainless steel). Copper binds to cellular proteins, altering their structure and thus their ability to function. And like iron, copper has redox potential so it can also undergo the Fenton reaction, taking or trading electrons between Cu^1+^ and Cu^2+^ to generate hydroxyl radicals (negatively charged oxygen species like OH- or OH˙ that damage DNA).\nFigure 2. Enterobactin uses catechols (red) to bind iron and copper. Source. Yersiniabactin is one siderophore that can bind copper, defending against both copper toxicity and reactive oxygen species. Enterobactin can also bind copper, but only after oxidation of the siderophore by the protein CueO. Enterobactin binds iron using three structural features called catechol rings (circled in Fig. 2). If these rings are left unoxidized in the non-iron-bound-siderophore they can reduce copper, which worsens toxicity. By oxidizing enterobactin, CueO both helps the siderophore bind toxic copper and prevents it from becoming more toxic.\nBoth copper and reactive oxygen species are encountered by infection-causing bacteria within macrophages, which use those methods to kill invaders. Two siderophores that use catechol rings to bind iron, salmochelin and enterobactin, can protect bacteria against the “oxidative burst”. The catch is that they must be inside the cell. The Staphylococcus siderophore staphyloferrin B also protects against reactive oxygen species, but siderophores that lack catechols, such as yersiniabactin and aerobactin, aren’t protective.\nSignaling Instead, yersiniabactin appears to act as a signaling molecule with the immune response. The siderophore has been shown to help Klebsiella pneumoniae infections spread and increase inflammation (which increases the production of reactive oxygen species). Other siderophores act as signals to cells of either the same or differing bacterial species. Researchers have also found boron-bound siderophores in seawater, where boron is quite common. Since bacteria don’t require boron and the boron-siderophore structure is different from iron-bound siderophore, the authors suggest that they function as signaling molecules instead of scavengers. Perhaps their signalling function is similar to pseudomonad pyoverdine, which helps to regulate its own production, as well as that of other proteins like toxins.\nFigure 3. When E. coli and B. subtilis are grown on agar together (top left), B. subtilis begins sporulation indicated by the expression of fluorescent proteins (bottom left). However, culturing B. subtilis with B. circulans (top right), doesn’t induce sporulation (bottom right). Source, Fig. 1. Some strains of bacteria belonging to the Firmicute phylum, such as Clostridia and Bacillus, form endospores. Endospores are like survival pods that enable the bacteria to survive harsh conditions. The process of endospore formation (sporulation) occurs in response to environmental signals, such as low nutrient levels. Recently, researchers have identified another one, siderophores. When Bacillus subtilis imports siderophores produced by other species (e.g., enterobactin from E. coli), this triggers sporulation. Sporulation frees up resources for E. coli but enables long-term survival for B. subtilis.\nStriking The poaching of siderophores by non-producing bacterial species (such as enterobactin import by B. subtilis) is common in the microbial world.

Underrepresented groups face a complex set of barriers to achieving faculty status, including imposter syndrome, increased performance expectations, and patterns of exclusion. Institutionalized racism and sexism have contributed to these barriers and perpetuated policy that excludes underrepresented minorities. These barriers can contribute to decreased feelings of belonging, which may result in decreased retention of underrepresented minorities. Though some universities have altered their hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool, these changes have not been sufficient. Here we argue that departmental invited seminar series can be used to provide trainees with scientific role models and increase their sense of belonging while institutions work towards more inclusive policy. In this study, we investigated the demographics (gender and race) of invited seminar speakers over 5 years to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan. We also investigated current trainee demographics and compared them to invited speaker demographics to gauge if our trainees were being provided with representation of themselves. We found that invited speaker demographics were skewed towards Caucasian men, and our trainee demographics were not being represented. From these findings, we proposed policy change within the department to address how speakers are being invited with the goal of increasing speaker diversity to better reflect trainee diversity. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of suggestions and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of underserved groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or subfields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia.","tags":["DEI","Data Analysis"],"title":"Suggestions for Improving Invited Speaker Diversity To Reflect Trainee Diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Project","Portfolio"],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"af37fe9f934ed14df351d33ac739c61a","permalink":"https://alliancescc.github.io/project/fjmcollab/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fjmcollab/","section":"project","summary":"A multi-institutional collaboration studying applicant factors involved in the academic faculty job market.","tags":["Data Analysis"],"title":"The Faculty Job Market Collaboration","type":"project"}]
