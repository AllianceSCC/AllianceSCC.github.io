      <title>The &#39;Freewrite&#39; Method for Scientific Writing</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_freewrite/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_freewrite/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the importance of pre-writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_warm_up/&#34;&gt;warm ups&lt;/a&gt;, we can’t always make it happen. Perhaps we were too preoccupied with another problem to focus during the warm up period. Or maybe a meeting ran over and we had to rush between tasks, skipping the warm up altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you sit down to write and your mind is blank, try the freewrite method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freewriting is a stream of consciousness method that can help direct your mind to the task at hand. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit down with an open word document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start typing anything that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue typing, and remind yourself what your writing task is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep typing everything that goes through your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually this mental conversation will transition entirely to the writing task at hand. It might look pretty messy, and later you’ll need to delete the extraneous text. If successful, however, you’ve added words to your draft, and that is what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, it might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ugh, ok, it’s 7:30 in the morning and I’m tired but I really need to finish this writing blog. I think I’m supposed to be writing about the freewriting method, which is a method that I advocate for a lot. There’s something helpful about being able to type without worrying about what goes on the page. Anyway, so how it works is that you just sit down and start typing, and typing, and typing to see what comes out. Eventually, you can get your brain warmed up and focused on the writing task at hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, freewriting about the freewriting method is a bit&amp;hellip; unusual, but hopefully you’ve gotten the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve recommended the freewriting method to nearly everyone who has told me that they need to write something, but they don’t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to write. The beautiful part about freewriting is that it truely, does not matter what goes on the page, especially in the beginning. And even after you’ve warmed up to the topic, you can &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to write in a stream of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freewriting gives you the freedom to write whatever you want about your topic, in whatever order or phrasing makes sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can almost guarantee that if you’ve done your literature review and are at the point to generate a first draft, the freewriting method can get &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 70 to 80% of your content on the page. Again, yes, it will be messy writing and you’ll need to clean it up, maybe reorganize, rephrase, and refine to fit the flow of the outline. But the essential information will be there &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you to revise, which was the initial goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freewriting is a warm-up method that can also be applied to the drafting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The &#39;Method&#39; Method for Scientific Writing</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_method/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_method/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This writing method, the method, is better described as a writing ritual. Whether or not your brain has been adequately &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_warm_up/&#34;&gt;warmed up&lt;/a&gt; with a writing warm up and is ready to transition to writing, it always helps to have an external, perhaps physical, cue that it is time to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact ritual will, of course, vary from person to person. It can also vary according to the type of writing task as the mental state and process for writing a letter of recommendation or grant is necessarily different from that of drafting a manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preference is to make a hot cup of coffee or tea before I sit down to write. The process of making the drink, along with the soothing comfort of holding a hot mug, help me to relax and shift my focus to writing. Other rituals can be a bit more&amp;hellip; extreme, like the famous authors who &lt;a href=&#34;https://lithub.com/7-methods-for-writing-your-first-draft/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; sleep next to their manuscript, or hang upside down in anti-gravity boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t already have a pre-writing ritual or habit, create one. Choose your ritual, whether it’s changing your sweater, eating a special snack, or putting on headphones, then make sure you repeat it &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; that you start to write. You may not notice much at first, but as you build the habit, you will begin responding more and more quickly to your chosen cue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lithub.com/7-methods-for-writing-your-first-draft/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from the Literary Hub has another perspective on using the Method to write your first draft.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Scientific Writing Warm Ups (and Exercise) are Essential</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_warm_up/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_warm_up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you tried to run, I don’t know, a mile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was back in 2015 for me. So I know that if I tried to get up a run a mile right now, it would &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; go well. If I did finish, it would be done slowly; it doesn’t make sense for me to expect anything different. If I trained for it every day, though, then I could expect to quickly run a mile next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you wrote for more than 20 minutes in a single sitting? Or sat down to write at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-writing-warm-ups-and-exercise-are-essential&#34;&gt;Why Writing Warm Ups (and Exercise) are Essential&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you only do it when you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to. And since your brain is like a muscle, it doesn’t adjust well to different and larger-than-normal tasks: like writing that first 3,000 word paper or the yearly grant. Binge writing — writing only when a large task needs to be completed immediately — leaves you mentally exhausted and requires days, if not longer, to recover from. Before long, you begin to hate the idea of writing, which leads to further procrastination and a never ending cycle of binge writing and writing hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difficult (and unfair) ask for muscles are rapid transitions between tasks. An athlete doesn’t sit on the couch then compete with cold muscles; they do a warm up first, mimicking the activity they’re about to perform, which prepares their muscles for strenuous activity. Warm ups enhance muscle performance and prevent injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it’s unfair to expect an academic to immediately transition from demanding bench work to writing on a grant. The brain needs a warm up, too. Enhanced performance in writing means time saved, and while brain injury is unlikely, do you really want to give yourself another reason to avoid writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, academics are expecting too much of themselves when they:
(i) Binge write (i.e., run a mile without training), and
(ii) Write cold (i.e., skip a warm up activity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-a-writing-warm-up&#34;&gt;What’s a Writing Warm Up?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about what a writing warm up &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another task that you need to fit into your day,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly complicated, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional for a smooth transition to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a thought process that requires some planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, a writing warm up is using a low cognition task to create a mental buffer, or transition period, between one cognitively demanding task and another (e.g., tricky experiments and writing, or data analysis and writing). The exact low cognition task will vary from person to person and day to day, but it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; fit one criterion: it only uses muscle memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing a low cognition task (e.g., walking, driving, washing dishes, or folding clothes) before you write allows you to begin &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; about your writing task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending this five to ten minutes (or more) thinking about &lt;em&gt;what you are going to write before you write it&lt;/em&gt; is your writing warm up. This process cognitively transitions yourself for a productive writing session. I say it takes planning because it will take effort to identify a suitable warm up task, and remember to avoid it until immediately before your writing session. It also takes some effort to avoid mental distractions during the warm up. Writing warm ups are an essential part of my writing process now. It is satisfying to open a writing project and immediately begin typing because the words are ready and waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-you-practice-writing&#34;&gt;How Do You Practice Writing?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, like anything else, you just do it. A lot. I’m not going to dwell here because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; just like physical exercise; find a writing task and start with 20 minute sessions. For the days that you don’t have an essential writing task lined up, blogging, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/SSRN-id3039505.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;science-related Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; entries, and/or &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.reedsy.com/creative-writing-prompts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;writing prompts&lt;/a&gt; can help keep your skills honed between essential writing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bottom Line:
(i) Warm up with a low cognitive task that allows you to mentally transition to writing.
(ii) Exercise your writing “muscles” frequently with at least 3, 20 minute sessions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Intro to Methods for Writing the First Manuscript Draft</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/draft_methods_intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most frustrating parts of the scientific writing process is actually getting words to paper, aka “the first draft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon (for me, anyway) that after finding the time and having the energy to put words to paper, they fail to present themselves. It’s a frustrating feeling that can lead to doubting myself as both a writer and an academic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget that the brain is like a muscle and that writing is a skill. Even the most skilled track and field athletes warm up differently to run the 100 meter dash than to throw the javelin. Furthermore, being skilled at both events requires an athlete to learn and apply two different sets of techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar concept applies to being an academic and/or scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing experiments, conducting experiments, and writing a manuscript are all essential skill sets that require distinct techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of a blog series that will explore and describe several methods and techniques (below) for approaching the drafting process. Some of these may work as “warm ups&#39;&#39; to transition your brain to the writing process. Others will be techniques to be employed directly in the drafting step. None are meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this series is to provide academic writers, like yourself, with tools to personalize and improve the writing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to experiment with them, find what works for you, and then tell me about it. What worked? What didn’t work? Why not? Perhaps your experience will make it into a future post. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>Welcome to Wowchemy, the website builder for Hugo</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/getting-started/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It&amp;rsquo;s a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a &lt;strong&gt;no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)&lt;/strong&gt; and having &lt;strong&gt;flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Identify the Story to Make Your Writing Process More Effective</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/central_message_narrative/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/central_message_narrative/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deciding what to write about is generally pretty easy for a researcher. Here’s my research topic. Read. Take notes. Write the manuscript. But approaching the prewriting and drafting stages of the writing process that way can waste precious time and energy, so here are a couple of things you can do to focus your prewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prewriting is the first step in your journey to a manuscript or review paper. It precedes the drafting stage and is the step that will likely take the longest. During prewriting you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decide what you’re going to write about,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make an outline of your paper, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and take notes, aka “review the literature”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem straightforward (albeit overwhelming), the prewriting process is crucial to all following steps of the writing process. A haphazard approach to prewriting can result in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-essential research,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disorganized writing full of tangents, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longer/more difficult revision process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which add up to lost time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means you need a solid prewriting strategy, which is determined in the first (seemingly shortest) action of the writing process: deciding your topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two tips to focus your ideas during step one of prewriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identify-the-central-message&#34;&gt;Identify the central message.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central message is one or two sentences that identify what you want your reader to know when they are done reading your scientific text. Since these are for planning purposes, they are often jargon heavy and don’t make it into your article intact. Instead, the central message helps guide you, the author, in identifying key information that needs to be included in your outline and literature review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, my dissertation work studied how the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt; gathered iron using a small molecule called a siderophore. Siderophores are exported and used to scavenge insoluble iron from the environment. One of the siderophores that &lt;em&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/em&gt; uses is called petrobactin. So, when I was planning my dissertation defense the central message for my talk was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Petrobactin is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/6/e02079-18.abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;required for rapid sporulation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/em&gt; and is &lt;a href=&#34;https://mbio.asm.org/content/8/5/e01238-17.short&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;exported by ApeX&lt;/a&gt;, but petrobactin fragments can support &lt;em&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/em&gt; disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is jargon heavy and did not become an explicit sentence in my defense. However, it narrows down the information that will be included. For instance, if I’m discussing petrobactin use by &lt;em&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/em&gt;, then I don’t need to discuss other bacteria that may use petrobactin (which is important information for a review paper about petrobactin). Additionally, if I’m focusing on the role of petrobactin in sporulation, then I can keep my discussion of spore germination to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;identify-your-scientific-narrative&#34;&gt;Identify your scientific narrative.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative is going to be the overarching structure of your paper. Like the central message, this is jargon heavy and will not be directly included in the body of your paper. However, it helps further guide you in determining the information that needs to be included and what information or concepts are tangential. The most generalized narrative structure was characterized by Randy Olson in his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo21174162.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Houston, We Have a Narrative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here, Olson describes the ABT narrative structure, which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Therefore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it appears unassuming, the ABT narrative has a lot to offer scientists. There’s too much to cover in this blog post, so here’s an overview (an ABT workshop will be offered in the future). Most stories can be crafted with a single ABT wherein the AND lays the background information and context, the BUT introduces a conflict or something unexpected, and the THEREFORE describes a solution or conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this article was drafted from a brief ABT narrative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A - What is prewriting AND what steps are generally included in the first stage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B - BUT a poor prewriting strategy can cause problems,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T - THEREFORE, here are two key concepts (central message and ABT) to guide the author through the writing process more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look back at the overall structure of this blog post, you can see how my ABT forms the skeleton of the writing. Similarly, the ABT helps inform my overall outline, as well as what information is relevant or not. In the ABT, I’ve committed myself to tips that make prewriting more effective for an organized draft. That means I’m not discussing how to manage references. While that’s important and easily locating your references makes adding citations more efficient, it doesn’t directly contribute to the organization of your writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, each science story, or manuscript, requires two distinct narrative ABTs. The first is the Question ABT, which generally provides the skeleton of the introduction, rationale, and methodology of the study. The second is the Answer ABT, which describes and organizes the results and their discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the example of my dissertation defense, the narrative describing my first research paper on export of petrobactin from &lt;em&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/em&gt; was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known siderophore-associated proteins are upregulated in low iron conditions AND some known siderophore exporters belong to these different transport protein families. BUT there are many potential siderophore exporters in &lt;em&gt;B. anthracis&lt;/em&gt;. THEREFORE, we have developed a bioinformatics protocol to target potential petrobactin exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After screening many different potential exporters, petrobactin is exported from the ApeX protein AND accumulates in the cell pellet of ΔApeX mutants. BUT ΔApeX exports functional petrobactin fragments THEREFORE it can still cause disease in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ABTs helped identify the structure of the outline and was particularly helpful in deciding the order in which data should be introduced in the results section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By identifying the central message and narrative of your scientific text, you can help eliminate tangential information. Additionally, having a handle on the eventual narrative of your research paper can prevent a dense, unorganized data-dump draft.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Three Tips to Organize Thesis and Article Sources</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/organize_research/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/organize_research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the course of a literature review, you may come across hundreds of research papers that will contribute to your understanding of the field and possibly even be cited in a manuscript. So how do you keep track of these sources?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write an annotated bibliography&lt;/strong&gt; - An annotated bibliography is going to be a list of the sources that you’ve read along with important notes to explain the source’s importance and relevance to your research. While some people do this by hand, that can be laborious, particularly when you are searching for a source after the fact. My suggestion for the modern annotated bibliography is to use a searchable format such as Word, Rmarkdown, OneNote, or EndNote, etc. That will allow you to easily re-reference a source and (re)identify sources that talk about particular concepts. Below is a list of components to include in each entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citation&lt;/strong&gt; - In addition to the author(s) and year of publication, you should also make a note of the doi (so you can find it later using &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/[insert doi]&lt;/a&gt;), and the filename of the pdf. The filename is especially important since it allows you to find the pdf you already have, without opening 20 files one-by-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; - Are any of the methods used especially relevant to your work? This might be because you need the protocol, they are key to interpreting the data, and/or are insufficient (i.e., they provide an opportunity for you to improve the field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; - What are the key results and findings? What figure is central to their story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations&lt;/strong&gt; - What are the limitations of the research? What could be done differently to improve the robustness of the research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your thoughts&lt;/strong&gt; - What do you think about the paper? Use this as an opportunity to present your unfiltered thoughts, feelings, musings, and big ideas. That way you can find them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow up&lt;/strong&gt; - Are there any references that you should read in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a spreadsheet&lt;/strong&gt; - Spreadsheets are another option for keeping track of the sources you have identified in a searchable and easy to skim format. In this case, you would likely have more information about the source’s origins, citations, accessibility, etc. (See &amp;ldquo;Organizing Sources&amp;rdquo; in the resources below for a template)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a citation management system&lt;/strong&gt; - Some citation management systems are great for keeping track of relevant sources. Mendeley is a particularly good option because you can import, read, highlight, annotate, and search for a pdf. However, it has undergone some recent changes that make it more difficult to use and transfer your references if necessary. (See the resources below for some handy web tools)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Where to Start (and When to Stop) a Lit Review</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/when_to_stop/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/when_to_stop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a literature review for thesis and article writing, everyone has the same three questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where do I start?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When do I stop?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I stay organized?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we’ll cover some tips for answering the first two questions. Next week’s post will address organizing sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-do-i-start-the-lit-review&#34;&gt;Where do I start the lit review?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s important to first get a sense of the overall field, and where you’ll begin with this depends on your level of experience in the field. If you are completely new to the field, then beginning with a relevant Wikipedia article may be right for you. Like academic literature, &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6351/557.2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wikipedia entries&lt;/a&gt; have references which can point you to relevant articles in the literature. However, if you’re familiar with the field and haven’t done an in depth literature review in it  yet, then reading both a dated (at least 5 to 10 years old) and a recent (in the last 1 to 2 years) review article can help you understand the overall progress of the field and identify important articles and themes. Finally, those with high experience and knowledge in the field may choose to begin by reviewing the most recent publications using Google Scholar or a similar source.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Where to begin a literature review, according to your experience in the field.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outline&lt;/strong&gt; - Before you begin the literature review, you should have developed an &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/why_outline/&#34;&gt;outline&lt;/a&gt;. Now that you have an understanding of the big picture, re-evaluate the outline for missing pieces, logical flow, and potential redundancies. If things seem overwhelming, pick a topic or subtopic to begin your research at. You could either ease into the process by choosing a topic you know fairly well, or pick the area where you are the weakest and know you will need to spend the most time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-do-i-stop-reading-and-start-writing&#34;&gt;When do I stop reading and start writing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a deadline&lt;/strong&gt; - Consider allocating a specific amount of time to the initial research stage of your writing process. This may help you be more efficient with your research time and gives a non-negotiable deadline to start putting words to paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep track&lt;/strong&gt; - Keep a log or journal where you note the search terms and databases that you have used to find sources. Have you exhausted your options? If so, consider asking a colleague or your advisor if they have additional suggestions for search terms and/or resources. If not, or you feel confident with your search thus far, then it might be time to start your first draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update your outline&lt;/strong&gt; - The outline should help guide your reading and information gathering, and should be updated as you work through each topic and subtopic. When each section seems to have a reasonable number of points, then you probably have enough information for the first draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your mental load&lt;/strong&gt; - Sometimes you will come across a new piece of information or perspective that will shift your thought process. Sometimes there will be so much information in your head that there doesn’t seem to be room for any more. Any time there are thoughts that seem to be swirling, then it’s time to put them to paper. Maybe this means that after spending a few days on a subtopic your brain feels overwhelmed, so you stop and draft a few paragraphs before you move on to the next. Or maybe you’ll research 50% or 90%, or even 100%, of the outline before this happens and you stop for a few days to get all of the information out of your head and onto paper. Either way, figuring out what works for you will give you a better idea of when it’s time to stop reading and start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t stress&lt;/strong&gt; - Remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/writing_process/&#34;&gt;writing is iterative&lt;/a&gt; so you can always (and probably will) come back to the research stage later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why an Outline is Necessary for Science Writing</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/why_outline/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/why_outline/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next step in the prewriting process is the outline, but what is it and why should you make one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should have your topic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/central_message_narrative/&#34;&gt;central message, and narrative&lt;/a&gt;. You will build on those to create an outline, the next layer in organizing your paper before you begin to write. But aside from personal preference, why create an outline at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save yourself time and effort. The outline serves several purposes that all contribute to reducing the amount of revision your first draft will need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Reduce mental load.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there are probably a lot of bits and pieces of your paper that are floating around in your head. The outline is a perfect place to keep these for future use. Getting them out and onto paper frees up a lot of brainspace, which you’ll need for the research stage of prewriting. Additionally, the bullet point format will demonstrate the areas where you either have, or lack, expertise. And now you have a handy structure to add information &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; during your literature review to help track your progress .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Improve organization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bullet point format is also helpful for preempting repetitive information and making connections between topics to improve the overall flow of your manuscript. By outlining each section and their paragraphs first, you can ensure that each paragraph is essential in advancing your narrative and more easily identify (and rearrange) related information or logical connections to aid topic transitions. If you’re feeling stuck, there are outline prompts and resources at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Ensure advisor compatibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can feel pretty defeating to write a 4,000 word first draft that your advisor either completely rearranges or scraps. Avoid that frustration for both you and your advisor by presenting them with a detailed outline. Going over the outline with your advisor can help eliminate potential problems by identifying areas that will need to be expanded, moved, or eliminated all together. Working with your advisor on the outline will also give both of you confidence in the drafting process, since you both have an understanding of what will be discussed and the order. To get the most out of the discussion, consider waiting until you have a more detailed post-literature review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/writing_process/&#34;&gt;the writing process is messy&lt;/a&gt;, so your first outline won’t be perfect. Instead, much like your final product, it will be in constant flux until you’ve moved past the revision stage. The upside is that it’s easier to change bulleted text instead of prose!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outline-prompts&#34;&gt;Outline Prompts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction or Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What information and/or context will the reader need to adequately understand everything that will be presented in the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the rationale for the study? What gap is it addressing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What key techniques were used in the study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results (each subsection)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the rationale for the experiment, what question will it answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the key points of setup that the reader needs to know to draw conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the possible conclusions from this experiment? What would the results be for each outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your conclusion based on the described results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion or Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, what were the major results and conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put your findings in context with other studies, where do they line up or contradict?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these findings mean for the field at large?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the limitations to your conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want your reader to do and/or remember from your results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Scientific Writing is Messy. That’s Perfect.</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/writing_process/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/post/writing_process/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The scientific writing process can be summarized in five steps: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and finally… publication. It seems straightforward, but also&amp;hellip; overwhelming. Especially when you’re tasked with starting at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that while writing is a lot of work, it can be made more approachable. This post is the first in a series that will explore the writing process and break it down into actionable pieces, with an emphasis on writing in the biological and biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll begin by describing the overall writing process and workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prewriting - generate ideas, identify evidence and sources, and craft outlines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafting - transform the outline into logically connected sentences and paragraphs, add evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revising - reorganize the draft, add evidence, eliminate tangents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing - correct misspellings and grammar, check citations and figures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publication - submit for grading (or peer review)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the general process appears to be linear.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-what-we-think-the-writing-process-is-like-linear&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;What we think the writing process is like. Linear.&#34; srcset=&#34;

               src=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/post/writing_process/writing_process_linear_hu505d8ad4a4021a1134ad263daf931d17_5271_0049405cc553350ed823b5900c083896.png&#34;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      What we think the writing process is like. Linear.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in practice, the effective writing process is quite a bit messier (image 2). For instance, after writing a first draft, the author often identifies topics that need more elaboration and/or evidence, which send them back through the prewriting and drafting steps. Even after a manuscript is done and submitted to a research advisor or reviewer, it often comes back with requests for revision. To accomplish those revisions, the author may need to revisit the prewriting and drafting steps again, followed by revising and editing for resubmission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      A better representation of the writing process. Iterative.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the real writing process may seem even more overwhelming. After all, how are you supposed to know when to move forward or backward? How will you know when you’re done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are valid fears, and the beauty of an iterative writing process is that you don’t really have to answer them. Approaching writing as an iterative process, as opposed to linear, has multiple advantages. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced pressure for first drafts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More realistic writing expectations,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More accurate writing timeline, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sections in different stages of the process allows for workload flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific writing is an act of creativity that requires freedom to think, synthesize, and explore new ideas. Removing the pressure for the first draft to be perfect, or near perfect, allows you as a writer to start the writing process more creatively with bigger, messier ideas. As the ideas are refined, they might lead to unexpected connections and conclusions, but it’s hard to know unless they are given voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because you begin the process knowing that prewriting, drafting, and revising will be revisited, there is less pressure for each step to be “complete” before moving on to the next. Set goals for the amount of time of words that you’ll spend on each step and when you’re done, start over. The more you write, the more accurate expectations you can develop for the time and effort spent at each step, leading to more accurate writing timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An added bonus is that you can break down the writing task into smaller chunks, and work through the writing process for each individual section. If you have sections at varying stages (e.g., introduction is in prewriting, methods are in revising, discussion is in drafting), then you have freedom in the type of writing you will accomplish on any given day. Tired of putting words on the page? Read literature and work on prewriting the introduction. Mentally burnt out but still want to make progress? Add citations to the methods section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the demands of a linear writing process seem overwhelming to you. It’s understandable. Approaching writing as an iterative process may help overcome some of the mental obstacles in the way of your next writing task. This brief overview of the writing process will be followed by posts exploring each step in more detail and providing strategies to tackle them. For now, if your best laid writing plans aren’t working out, don’t feel alone. Writing is messy. And that’s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tips for Getting Writing Done in Pandemic Purgatory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of January, one month before Michigan responded to the pandemic by closing non-essential services, I pulled my 3-year-old from daycare. I was (and still am) attempting to launch a business, but our back up funds had run dry and we could no longer afford childcare. As it happened, I got an early taste of the pandemic dilemma that millions have faced since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work is a large part of my identity and in this extended lack of childcare, my brain will not turn off. Unlike many, I don’t have the external motivating factors of an institution who demands more than I can give, but neither can I put my work on hold to embrace the single job of stay-at-home parenting. The internal motivators, and the normalcy that it provides, are too strong. So, like many others I am stuck in this pandemic purgatory where housework, childcare, and my own motivations are in constant opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some things I’ve learned while trying to live, and write, in my purgatory. Perhaps they will be helpful for others. The caveat is that while I solo parent during the work day (6am to ??),  I do have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/covid-19-pandemic-privilege?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many pandemic privileges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that may affect how well these tips work for you. That said, here are my suggestions for maintaining sanity-saving levels of writing and productivity in our collective pandemic purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-up-with-self-care&#34;&gt;Keep up with self-care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is a creative act that consumes a lot of mental energy, so self-care remains as important as ever.  In addition to the existential threat of a pandemic, the availability of digital workplaces (e.g., Zoom, Slack, Google Drive) enables (even enforces) bringing our work lives home in an unprecedented way, creating unprecedented stress. Whether it’s paying the bills, making the (virtual) therapy appointment, or taking a bath, we must provide ourselves with the opportunity to reduce our stress levels whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know that humans need adequate sleep to be productive. In fact, the stress created by sleep deprivation can reduce the productivity of any time gained. Similarly, the excessive amount of work-from-home-and-homeschool-my-child-during-a-pandemic stress might cause post-lunch exhaustion or irritability. That’s your cue to take a nap, work out, or practice a similar stress-relief technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice-delegating&#34;&gt;Practice delegating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can accept taking my car to a mechanic for an oil change, but when it comes to my work, I’m the queen of “Oh, I’ll just do it myself.” That approach used to work, since I had childcare and the luxury of time and focus to figure it out. Now that I don’t have either, I’ve finally realized that I need to delegate tasks that don’t absolutely require my skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really have the mental load available to learn Adobe Illustrator right now? Probably not, so find a professional to make your graphic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you read your grant proposal so many times that you have it memorized? Now’s the time to have a professional editor look it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you facepalming to the tune of R errors? Find a data analyst and get some help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegation (i.e., trusting someone else with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; work) is tough, but essential to retain your limited mental load, sanity, and productivity. Additionally, plenty of small businesses and freelancers could use the extra business right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bargain&#34;&gt;Bargain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son loves the new norm of virtually unlimited access to me. I had difficulty adjusting. It would be difficult to negotiate the abrupt transition from the traditional 9 to 5 to our new work conditions alone, but adding children, roommates, and/or partners makes it all the more difficult. That’s why I suggest just that, negotiating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the upheaval of our lives and validating the fears, frustrations, and desires of our fellow captives is the first step to establishing a functional household. My son’s desire for a constant playmate and parent is valid and expected, but counterproductive to my own mental health. So, I negotiate boundaries that enable both of us to get what we need. These are some of the resources that have resulted in productive negotiations in our household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not very good at schedules, but I have an ideal schedule&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that alternates between work and play. I make it very clear that I have to work for 2 hours, after which we will do whatever activity he chooses. Then I set a timer and stick to our agreement. After lunch, another 2 hours are blocked out for “quiet time”, i.e., I work and he naps or plays in his room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strategy to negotiate time is pushing back bedtime. My son doesn’t nap and tends to function in 12 hour sleep/wake cycles; unless my depression is acting up, I get up with my husband at 6 am. With a standard 8/9pm bedtime, this allows me one to two hours of uninterrupted work. Mornings are my most productive time of the day, so to maximize my time we started allowing my son to stay up later, and later, and later. Eventually, he was going to bed around midnight (hubby is a night owl) and sleeping until almost 11am. Hello half a work day! Disclaimer: This only worked a few weeks. Then he fell asleep at 5pm one night, woke up at 6am and we were back where we started &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;desirables&#34;&gt;Desirables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work versus play time has been negotiated, we enter the “desirable” bargain (aka bribing) phase. Here, my son requests something that will better facilitate his solo play time. A common request is screen time, which is an automatic given for the “quiet time” described above. If his tablet isn’t available, I generally give up my phone for him to watch videos. YouTube for Kids is pretty dicy, so instead I open either Netflix or the &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; PBS Video app, which features favorites like Daniel Tiger and the Kratt brothers. Sometimes, a favorite snack or treat is the missing ingredient to successful solo play. My son most often requests hot chocolate or an ice pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, there aren’t any desirables that will facilitate work/writing time. Instead, he wants to do an activity “with you!” and we negotiate attention for proximity. I pick a task that I can do with slightly less focused mental labor, and sit next to him while he plays or watches a favorite show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-accountability&#34;&gt;Find accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we have found the time and mental space to work, it’s easy to get distracted by the latest Twitter dumpster fire. This is where accountability comes into play. Find an accountability partner to set goals with and report back to. Having defined goals helps prevent the “what am I doing” overwhelm that often leads (me) to Twitter. Alternately, you and your accountability partner(s) could schedule video calls during overlapping work hours. Not for talking, but for working in tandem, which facilitates focus for both of you. An added bonus is having adult human contact to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific productivity is a core component of my identity and a symbol of normalcy that maintains my sanity. Taking care of myself, working with my fellow housemates, delegating tasks, and finding accountability have all been integral to maintaining any level of productivity.  While the above suggestions may not &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; like writing tips, they all contribute to that first essential step of writing: doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandemic Privileges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband has continued working, so we have not lost our primary income&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a large house with a yard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have technology: TV, internet, computers, tablet, phones, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the cash flow and space to store food to minimize exposure and reduce stress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have our own transportation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, my ideal schedule is to work from 6:30 am until my son wakes up. Then we take a breakfast break and he plays/has screen time for another couple of hours. At 11am we go outside until lunch at 12:30. After lunch is a 2 hour &amp;ldquo;quiet time&amp;rdquo; followed by chores and my workout. Then it&amp;rsquo;s snack time, after which we play whatever my son wants until it&amp;rsquo;s time for dinner, bath, and bed.

      <title>Examining Flint: New research highlights lack of legionella public policy</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been three years and 11 months since the residents of Flint, Michigan have had clean drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the city water source was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014, residents fell victim to corrosive, lead-contaminated water. Exposure to and consumption of that water through October 2015—when the water source was switched back—has led to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/31/health/iyw-flint-water-crisis-two-years-later/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;learning and developmental delays&lt;/a&gt; and correlates with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/flint-water-tied-to-fetal-death-and-lower-fertility-rates/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;decreased fertility&lt;/a&gt;. The water switch is now linked to deaths caused by the bacterial pathogen &lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; are gram-negative bacteria found throughout nature, where they infect amoebae. However, they can also live in built environments, such as reservoirs and water towers, where they form persistent biofilms from which bacteria are dispersed. When the water is used, people are exposed to the bacteria by inhaling aerosolized water droplets like those produced by showers and sprinkler systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in the lungs, legionellae can cause the infection known as Legionnaires’ disease. The bacteria invade and replicate in lung macrophages, which provide a replication environment similar to that in their amoebae hosts. Unchecked, the infection leads to pneumonia and a 10-&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/ndwactechforlegionellaslides.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;30% chance&lt;/a&gt; of death, primarily in those with compromised immune systems, including those over 50 and current or former smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although at least 24 species of &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; are associated with human disease, about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1128/CMR.00052-09&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;90% of Legionnaires&#39; cases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by &lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt;. This is the organism that University of Michigan professor and ASM President Elect Michele Swanson researches. Her work has focused on how legionellae replicate inside macrophages, evade degradation, and, more recently, persist in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Swanson’s expertise in legionellae and proximity to Flint meant she was ready and able to join a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/FWICC_Meeting_FACHEP_Presentation1-July_8_2016_528953_7.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;multidisciplinary&lt;/a&gt; team created to study the effects of changes in the Flint water source on public health. This research group, the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership (&lt;a href=&#34;http://flint.wayne.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FACHEP&lt;/a&gt;), also includes researchers from the Henry Ford Health System, Michigan State University, Colorado State University, the MADE Institute, Genesee Health Systems, and Kettering University. FACHEP was created in January 2016, when Michigan Governor Rick Snyder organized a  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/02/flint_legionnaires_researchers.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;$3.35-million contract&lt;/a&gt; with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Wayne State University to fund the collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Flint water crisis, there were 6 to 12 Legionnaires’ disease cases in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/05/582482024/lethal-pneumonia-outbreak-caused-by-low-chlorine-in-flint-water&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;typical year&lt;/a&gt; in the Flint area. When Flint’s source water was switched to the Flint River, there were 45 cases per year in 2014 and 2015. Nick Lyons, the former director of MDHHS, has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2017/06/14/532969059/two-top-michigan-officials-face-criminal-charges-over-flint-water-crisis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;charged with involuntary manslaughter&lt;/a&gt; for failing to respond to the Flint Legionnaires’ outbreak for more than a year, while the Chief Medical Executive, Dr. Eden Wells, has been charged with obstruction of justice. Wells has also been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2017/06/18/flint-legionnaires-charges-emails-doctor/102994738/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;accused of interfering&lt;/a&gt; with research conducted by the FACHEP group. If the MDHHS can show that the outbreak was limited to patients and visitors to the McLaren hospital in Flint (which has been plagued by hospital-associated Legionnaires’ disease), then a guilty verdict might be avoided. However, FACHEP’s recently published research doesn’t support the hypothesis of the MDHHS, who despite providing funding for the FACHEP, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-73970_71692_71696-459450--,00.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;disputes&lt;/a&gt; the findings from both papers. That funding will no longer be available following a contract dispute and was announced the day following publication of Zahran et. al in PNAS.&lt;/p&gt;

Before the water source was switched to the Flint River, chlorine levels at all eight locations clustered together with levels ranging between 0.2 and 1 mg/L. However, after the switch to Flint River water, the chlorine levels went haywire and fluctuated wildly between locations, ranging from almost 0 to 2.5 mg/liter (Figure 1). Levels restabilized after the water source was switched back to Lake Huron.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers plotted the probability of Legionnaires’ disease against Cl$_2$ levels they found that the chlorine concentration was predictive of disease occurrence. For chlorine to act as an effective disinfectant, it must be present as Cl$_2$ in levels of at least 0.2 mg/liter and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/chlorine-residual-testing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recommends 0.5 mg/liter&lt;/a&gt;. The odds of a person in Flint contracting Legionnaires’ disease increased by nearly threefold when the average weekly chlorine levels were below 0.5 mg/liter and by fourfold for weeks when chlorine was less than 0.2 mg/liter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that the organic matter in the Flint River, plus leached metals from pipe corrosion, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718679115&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;likely bound the chlorine&lt;/a&gt; and caused the levels to dip dangerously low. The ineffectively low chlorine levels combined with warm summer temperatures, allowed legionellae to thrive, spiking known cases of Legionnaires’ disease in the third quarters of 2014 and 2015. While their data indicate that chlorine concentrations in the water were predictive of Legionnaires’ disease among Flint residents, the data do not rule out other factors contributing to bacterial growth, like the greater abundance of nutrients (iron and organic matter) in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key part of the analysis in PNAS was to determine whether switching water sources in Flint led to an increased risk of Legionnaires’ disease. Researchers answered this question by comparing the occurrence of Legionnaires’ disease in Flint residents to disease occurrence in neighboring areas with a different water source. Comparing these data allowed researchers to determine odds ratios, or the likelihood that a random Flint resident would contract Legionnaires’ disease relative to residents of neighboring areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the researchers determined that switching the water source to the Flint River made a Flint resident 6.3 times more likely to contract Legionnaires’ disease than someone not exposed to the water. However, in September 2014, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/09/flint_expands_boil_water.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;boil water advisory&lt;/a&gt; was issued that caused residents to &lt;a href=&#34;https://phys.org/news/2018-03-economists-tracked-disease-flint-crisis.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;avoid Flint River city water&lt;/a&gt;, creating an interesting dynamic to examine. The researchers performed the same analysis, this time dividing Legionnaires’ cases into before and after the advisory. In this analysis, the odds ratio was 10 post-switch and pre-boil water advisory while the odds ratio was “only” 5.8 following the advisory. The odds of Legionnaires’ disease for Flint residents returned to normal (&amp;lt;1) when the water source was restored to Lake Huron. The researchers estimate that the city’s switch to the Flint River water was responsible for 80% of the reported cases of Legionnaires’ disease during that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following publication, the MDHHS issued a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/MDHHS_Response_to_FACHEP_Proceedings_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences_Article_FINAL_613088_7.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; stating that use of the referral date (when the case was reported) instead of the symptom onset date introduces error. However, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/171108_KWR_2017.081_final_report_scoping_mission_DEF_613090_7.PDF&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;researchers maintain&lt;/a&gt; that this doesn’t affect the overall results. Swanson’s study is in agreement with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;similar conclusion&lt;/a&gt; reached in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.6b00192&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a 2016 study&lt;/a&gt;.
In Flint between 2014 and 2015, 12 people died of Legionnaires and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/05/582482024/lethal-pneumonia-outbreak-caused-by-low-chlorine-in-flint-water&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;more than 80 fell ill&lt;/a&gt;. Those are only the known cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second FACHEP paper, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00016-18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;mBio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, compared clinical isolates obtained from Legionnaires’ cases in Southeast Michigan to legionellae isolated from homes in and around Flint. Byrne, et al. sampled plumbing (kitchen faucet, shower, and hot water heater) in 130 residences and isolated 2 non&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; legionellae and 16 &lt;em&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; strains from 13 Flint residences. Two &lt;em&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; strains were also isolated from non-Flint residences. Their first step was to characterize the relatedness of the isolated strains. Phylogenetic analysis separated the clinical isolates into four different clonal populations, one of which belonged to the same clonal group as a single environmental isolate. All but one of the other environmental isolates belonged to a separate clonal group. Further characterization of the environmental isolates in Swanson’s lab found that while all 33 of the clinical isolates belonged to serogroup (SG) 1, the environmental isolates were predominantly SG 6. Additionally, the SG 6 isolates performed just as well as SG 1 isolates in laboratory tests for macrophage infectivity and replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are significant because they indicate that the clinical isolates are not related and likely have different initial sources, which means that the patients weren’t exposed to the same strain of legionellae in the same location and suggests that the outbreak was not hospital-associated. The data also support what is already commonly accepted in the legionellae field—that cases of Legionnaires’ are drastically underreported, and that SG 1 strains cause those that are reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MDHHS issued &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/MDHHS_Response_to_FACHEP_American_Society_for_Microbiology_mBio_Article_rev_21318_613639_7.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; disputing the possibility of under diagnosis and reporting of Legionnaires’ disease caused by plumbing isolates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., it’s estimated that as few as 5% of Legionnaires’ disease cases are documented. Clinically, there’s little need for detailed diagnosis, since most patients presenting with pneumonia are immediately prescribed antibiotics. Patients are only tested for a specific bacterial cause if they don’t respond to therapeutics. Drug resistance in Legionnaires’ disease is not yet an issue, but surveillance of the disease is severely hampered since failing to diagnose also fails to generate data that could be important for setting policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, detection presents a problem. Patient sputum samples are notoriously difficult to obtain, and legionellae are particularly finicky to culture, requiring special growth medium, an experienced lab technician, and several days for growth. Even when present in the sputum sample they may not grow, particularly if the patient is already receiving antibiotics for the pneumonia. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/diagnostic-testing.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, culturing from sputum can positively identify 20-80% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test of choice for Legionnaires’ disease detects &lt;em&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; antigen from the urine in more than 70% of cases. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1086/345529&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;urinary antigen test&lt;/a&gt; is rapid and isn’t immediately affected by administration of antibiotics, but it has its own severe limitations: it only reacts to SG 1 antigen, and some patients may be so ill that they &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bridgemi.com/children-families/soaring-pneumonia-deaths-genesee-county-likely-linked-undiagnosed-legionnaires&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cannot produce urine&lt;/a&gt; for the test. There are other detection methods, but they suffer from cross-reactivity with other pathogens or aren’t available as a standardized assay. So, while there are at least 15 different serogroups of &lt;em&gt;L. pneumophila&lt;/em&gt;, only 5% of cases are ever confirmed by culture and &amp;gt;75% of known cases are caused by a single serogroup, SG1. It’s difficult to determine whether cases go unreported because diagnostic testing wasn’t performed or because a test (whether culture or antigen) failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the criminal cases against former MDDHS employees could be the catalyst for policies to protect public utilities consumers from water-borne pathogens such as &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. As it stands, water suppliers (e.g., municipal water systems) must monitor several water parameters, such as chlorine, on a weekly basis, but chlorine has a half-life of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_PC-020501_1-Feb-99.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;less than five hours&lt;/a&gt;, or even less in higher temperatures. This means that locations further away from municipal treatment plants, and places where water is stored, especially at warm temperatures such as in water heaters, are at increased risk of legionellae growth. While municipal water systems are also required to monitor water for bacteria that might cause gastrointestinal illnesses (e.g., &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;), there are no federal laws for water-borne respiratory pathogens such as legionellae. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thelegionnaireslawyer.com/legionnaires-disease-determining-liability/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Legal liability&lt;/a&gt; for outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease currently falls on the owners/operators of the facility at which the patient was exposed, as well as those responsible for installation and maintenance of the contaminated reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy changes would come none too soon. Reported cases of Legionnaires’ disease in the U.S. have increased by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/downloads/fs-legionella-clinicians.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;four and half times&lt;/a&gt; over the last 15 years and fewer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.567&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;than 5%&lt;/a&gt; of cases are outbreak related with the vast majority occurring sporadically. But proper surveillance of legionellae levels in the water supply, along with the already collected chlorine data, are needed for researchers to understand the prevalence of legionellae and the efficacy of chlorine as a disinfectant. While exposure to 0.4 mg/liter of chlorine for 15 minutes is sufficient to kill legionellae in the lab, Zahran et al. point out that it may not be effective against legionellae contained within amoebas or biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Swanson is carrying forward her research in Flint by working with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/CommitteeView.aspx?key=DELS-WSTB-16-02&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;team of experts&lt;/a&gt; at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to write a public report on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dels.nas.edu/Study-In-Progress/Management-Legionella-Water-Systems/DELS-WSTB-16-02&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;management of legionellae in water systems&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to surveying the current literature regarding legionellae ecology, human exposure, and management strategies, this white paper will also review current policies and hopefully make helpful recommendations for policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If You Give a Baby a Bath, and More Microbial Myths</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the five second rule real? Is your urine sterile? And do bacterial cells outnumber your own cells 10:1? These were some of the persistent microbial myths addressed in the video, “Microbial Myths.” Dr. Michael Schmidt and I began the discussion with some ASM history, after which Dr. Michael Schmidt explained the facts behind the 5-second rule and addressed other questions in depth. We followed this with a lightning round for short answers on some big questions, and the session wrapped with Dr. Schmidt on the spot as he accepted questions from the live audience at ASM Microbe 2018 in Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lightning round was fun but fast, and didn’t allow in-depth answers to a complex question, nor did we have time to address all of the questions from the audience. Let’s dive into the studies surrounding those questions here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-can-sanitize-your-sponge-in-the-microwave-verdict-myth&#34;&gt;You can sanitize your sponge in the microwave. Verdict: MYTH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchen sponges are the perfect breeding ground for bacteria: they’re warm and moist after use; they’re covered in pores that trap water and provide surfaces for bacteria to replicate; they come in contact with contaminated surfaces (like moldy food dishes and chicken-laden cutting boards), and they’re used for weeks or months at a time. This perfect storm makes it no surprise that sponges harbor more bacteria than anywhere else &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.org/newsroom_pdf/journal_of_envir_health_sept_2012_microbial_hotspots.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tested&lt;/a&gt; in the average home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several products and techniques claim to sanitize your kitchen sponges, so they can be “safely” reused. For instance, a Google search for “ways to sanitize a sponge” brought up websites suggested microwaving, vinegar, and bleach as some of the most prevalent DIY techniques to extend the lifespan of a sponge. But do these techniques work?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While studying the types of bacteria commonly found on sponges, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-06055-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; touched on this question. Using microscopy techniques, the researchers visualized bacteria growing inside the pores of 14 used kitchen sponges and found high bacterial counts (~10^7^ to 10^9^ cfus per sponge). DNA sequencing showed that about 36% of the bacteria on sponges belonged to the family Moraxellaceae, which is a common member of the skin microbiome. Other prevalent taxa were &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonadaceae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rhizobiaceae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Flavobacteriaceae&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcaceae&lt;/em&gt;. Some taxa, such as &lt;em&gt;Xanthomonadaceae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/em&gt;, varied according to the sponge tested, which might reflect the habits and food choices of the previous owners. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/1659784&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; also found &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Micrococcus&lt;/em&gt; to be prevalent on kitchen sponges. Potentially pathogenic bacteria seem to comprise only a small portion of the bacteria found on a sponge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can sanitizing your sponge eliminate these bacteria? In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-06055-9&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2017 study above&lt;/a&gt;, previous owners of some of the collected sponges reported to have “cleaned” their sponges regularly (either microwaving or rinsing with hot water). Despite cleaning, these sponges contained the same number of bacteria as non-sanitized sponges, but the makeup of the bacterial communities differed. Sponge sanitation clearly doesn’t kill all of the bacteria present on a sponge, and any surviving bacteria can quickly take over sponge real estate. This is due to the high numbers of bacteria that colonize the sponge surface: even if microwaving were to kill 99.9% of 10^7^ bacteria, almost 10,000 are still alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sanitizing the sponge, microwaving or using other techniques may predispose a sponge to harboring heartier bacterial species. Your best bet is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/09603120050127202&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rinse the sponge&lt;/a&gt; daily and replace it all together on a weekly basis or after wiping up raw egg or meat. If you’re concerned about the environmental impact of this suggestion, consider purchasing dye-free, biodegradable &lt;a href=&#34;http://twistclean.com/products/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sponges&lt;/a&gt; or using dishrags that can be frequently washed and dried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;delaying-babys-first-bath-helps-establish-the-skin-microbiome-verdict-probably-true&#34;&gt;Delaying baby’s first bath helps establish the skin microbiome. Verdict: Probably TRUE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newborn babies are covered with vernix caseosa, a thick Vaseline-like layer that protects their fragile skin from moisture &lt;em&gt;in utero&lt;/em&gt; and contains antibacterial enzymes such as lysozyme. On top of this, the birthing process coats newborns in blood and other bodily fluids, which might be contaminated with blood borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis C. These fluids, along with the vernix, are wiped away following birth and the newborn is bathed as soon as possible, in part to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/373017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;protect hospital staff&lt;/a&gt; from blood borne pathogens. The World Health Organization suggests that baby’s first bath should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00149525-201610001-00003&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;postponed for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; to prevent hypothermia, but many U.S. hospitals bathe the infant around eight hours post-birth unless the parents request otherwise. The life-threatening issue of hypothermia has guided much of the research and recommendations for infant bathing thus far. Only recently has research begun addressing the long-term impacts of bathing infants on the skin microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newborn skin microbiome generally establishes within 4-6 days and coincides with maturation of the newborn skin to retain water and block absorption of chemicals. The establishment of the microbiome can be tracked by a decrease in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-536x.2001.00161.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;skin pH from 6.34 to 4.95&lt;/a&gt;. So far, the data indicate that the newborn skin microbiome &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pnas.org/content/107/26/11971&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;starts out&lt;/a&gt; the same in all areas of the body and most closely reflects the microbiome it was initially exposed to, whether that be the vaginal or skin (due to C-section). Over time, the skin microbiome composition &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022202X15350363&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;becomes site specific&lt;/a&gt; and gradually becomes more like the adult skin microbiome as the child ages. As with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.asm.org/index.php/general-science-blog/item/461-i-can-t-eat-that-or-how-our-microbiome-influences-our-dietary-restrictions&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1533211473759000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEGqwPvqIbJV49nuEFfcKDP3eCnWQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, the skin microbiome has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568566/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;role in human health&lt;/a&gt; by protecting against potential pathogens, immune regulation, and alterations in the microbiome implicated in skin conditions such as eczema.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What effect, if any, does baby’s first bath have on establishment of the microbiome? A &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/path.1700950113&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1968 study&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that the number and types of bacteria present on the skin (as grown on agar) are not significantly changed by bathing in soap and water. Close examination of the graph, however, reveals that bacterial counts at most body sites drop at the bathing time (one hour post birth) then quickly recover. These results were replicated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-536x.2001.00161.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a 2001 study&lt;/a&gt; that compared the bacteria recovered from the skin of newborns immediately before their first bath in either water or mild soap and water, then one hour and 24 hours later. However, both of these studies relied on culturable bacteria to make their conclusions and there don’t seem to be any similar sequencing-based studies on full term infants to either confirm or refute their claims. Additionally, the impacts of bathing on the microbiome &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jp.7211332&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;seem to vary&lt;/a&gt; for pre-term infants, particularly since they are most likely to be bathed using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1097/ANC.0000000000000336&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antimicrobials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we know about the human microbiome in general, suggests that baby’s first bath would have an impact on the establishment of the skin microbiome. Along those lines, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1097/NMC.0000000000000374&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing&lt;/em&gt; makes some practical suggestions for safeguarding the establishing microbiome in a healthy, full-term infant. First, initiate immediate skin-to-skin contact and limit handling of the newborn by non-family members. It isn’t necessary to either completely remove the protective vernix or to give daily baths. Finally, ensure that only water or mild cleaning products are used on baby’s skin. It’s clear that more research is needed to completely resolve the impact of baby’s first bath on the skin microbiome, but for now we consider this microbial myth “probably true”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-steps-of-aseptic-technique-are-essential-verdict-its-complicated&#34;&gt;All steps of aseptic technique are essential. Verdict: It’s complicated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aseptic techniques originate from the labs of &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12045-007-0003-8.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.1017%2Fmdh.2012.22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Koch&lt;/a&gt;. These researchers developed many of the methodologies and techniques still used today by microbiologists. Isolating bacteria on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asm.org/index.php/general-science-blog/item/5895-women-in-science&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;agar plates&lt;/a&gt;, boiling as a form of sterilization (aka pasteurization), Koch’s postulates, and aseptic technique still prevail. Together, their experiments showed that microbes are all around us, on every surface we touch, and even in the air we breathe. Thus, to prevent contaminating their work, microbiologists take special precautions to protect their samples from environmental contaminants. Enter aseptic techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterilize media and tools by autoclave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wash your hands and disinfect the working surface to reduce the number of possible contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light a Bunsen burner that creates an upward draft of air to prevent contaminants in the air from settling on the work surface below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use that burner to sterilize tools such as inoculating loops and the opening of the tube or media bottle (just in case your loop accidentally touches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the dogma taught in every microbiology course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both my undergraduate and masters research were done in a lab that strictly adhered to all steps of aseptic technique, and still got the odd contaminated agar plate or bottle of broth. On the other hand, my doctoral research was done in a lab where I worked at a bench without ever lighting a Bunsen burner. The change in protocol was weird at first, but quickly became the new norm after contamination turned out to be less of an issue that I had anticipated. So the personal experiences of researchers like myself (and the audience member who suggested this myth) raise questions about whether some of these techniques are truly necessary at the lab bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might the experiences of contemporary microbiologists differ from Pasteur and Koch? In part, most early experiments on contamination from airborne microbes involved extensive exposure of the media to open air (e.g., beer in fermenting vats or broth sitting on a bench for days). Conversely, the brief exposure of a media bottle to the air when removing a bit of broth may not require the sterile airspace provided by a Bunsen burner, particularly since that airspace is very easily disturbed by rapid movement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many research labs now use pre-sterilized disposable tools to transfer media and bacterial cultures instead of reusable inoculating loops, a process &lt;a href=&#34;http://aem.asm.org/content/16/8/1146.short&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;known to create aerosols&lt;/a&gt; that may increase potential air contaminants. (A reason why some labs use bench top incinerators.) In other words, perhaps using a Bunsen burner to flame a loop, creates the need for the sterile airspace underneath the burner flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to uncover any research specifically addressing whether all steps of the aseptic technique dogma are absolutely necessary (if you know of one, please post it below!). Instead, aseptic technique has become so canonized in microbiology that I found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1002/9780471729259.mca04ds11&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;protocol paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Current Protocols in Microbiology&lt;/em&gt; that had zero citations. Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there’s enough history to indicate that many steps of aseptic technique are indeed essential, but there are also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-does-working-near-a-Bunsen-burner-when-working-with-bacteria-actually-maintain-a-sterile-bench&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;enough questions&lt;/a&gt; to welcome a study of the contributions of flaming techniques to maintaining an aseptic workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any Microbial Myths that haven’t been addressed? Comment below and maybe I’ll do another follow up! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go replace my kitchen sponge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Siderophores: A treatment target?</title>
      <link>https://alliancescc.github.io/project/siderophore_treatment_target/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alliancescc.github.io/project/siderophore_treatment_target/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In previous Microbial Science blog posts, I described how many bacterial pathogens rely on siderophores to help &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asm.org/index.php/general-science-blog/item/6411-siderophores-bacterial-iron-scavengers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;scavenge iron&lt;/a&gt; during infections as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asm.org/index.php/general-science-blog/item/6628-siderophores-bacterial-swiss-army-knives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;protect them&lt;/a&gt; from the immune response or competing bacterial species. But is there a way to take what we’ve learned about these essential molecules and use them to turn the tide against the wave of antibacterial resistance? Researchers are developing sideromycins, inhibitors and vaccines to turn siderophores against their makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sideromycins&#34;&gt;Sideromycins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an edge in survival against competing bacterial species, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asm.org/index.php/general-science-blog/item/6628-siderophores-bacterial-swiss-army-knives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;some bacteria&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00249977.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/em&gt; spp.&lt;/a&gt;) make sideromycins, siderophores conjugated with an antibiotic molecule. Sideromycins look like siderophores to other species of bacteria, which import them for their iron payload. But by bringing sideromycins in, the bacteria inadvertently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10534-008-9199-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;poison themselves&lt;/a&gt; with the attached antibiotic. Researchers have caught onto this trick and designed their own sideromycins to target bacterial pathogens. This is important work since antibacterial resistance is at an all-time high and the number of effective antibiotics is decreasing. Since most resistance mechanisms rely on keeping the antibiotics out, the Trojan Horse sideromycins might help antibiotics bypass these and target specific pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what researchers at the University of Notre Dame had in mind when they &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b00102&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;designed a sideromycin&lt;/a&gt; against the multidrug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt;. The authors conjugated the antibiotic daptomycin to the &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt; siderophore called fimsbactin and effectively treated infected mice. This is especially exciting because daptomycin is traditionally only effective against gram-positive bacteria, but by conjugating it to fimsbactin, they could use it to treat the gram-negative &lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt;, but not others (e.g., &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt;). Other groups have generated sideromycins against &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/bc300610f&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article/65/4/512/6133002&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Providencia stuartii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.2174/1568026013395524&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm400265k&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but this report is the first to show that the drugs can work in a mouse infection model. And unfortunately, it is possible for mechanisms to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.00205-06&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;prevent sideromycin import&lt;/a&gt; to evolve, thus creating resistance against sideromycins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inhibitors&#34;&gt;Inhibitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to co-opt our knowledge of siderophores is to generate new antibiotics that target siderophores and prevent their production or use by pathogens. There are two common pathways for siderophore biosynthesis in bacteria, and researchers have taken advantage of these similarities to identify small molecules that interact with and inhibit siderophore biosynthesis enzymes. In some cases, researchers use rational design to generate these small molecules. By taking what they know about the structure of the enzymes and how they function, researchers can generate small molecules that they think will act as inhibitors. Two 2005 studies described how researchers targeted an early step in siderophore biosynthesis by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;. One group designed molecules that interfered with a biosynthetic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm051060o&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;protein’s ability to bind ATP&lt;/a&gt;, while the other &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchembio706&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;targeted the ligand binding site&lt;/a&gt; of a biosynthetic protein and was also able to inhibit siderophore biosynthesis by &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt;. More recently, Dr. David Sherman’s lab at the University of Michigan &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja4115924&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;screened a library&lt;/a&gt; of naturally occurring small molecules for their ability to inhibit siderophore biosynthesis in &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;. In all of these cases, the identified molecules inhibited growth of the pathogen in a test tube, but none have been tested in a mouse model of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vaccines&#34;&gt;Vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to fight an infection is by preventing it from happening at all. With that in mind, Dr. Harry Mobley’s lab at the University of Michigan has been exploring siderophore-based vaccines against urinary tract infections. Initially, they tried to target the immune response against select siderophore receptors on the cell surface of urinary pathogenic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; (UPEC). With this method, they successfully vaccinated mice against the receptor for yersiniabactin and generate a protective immune response. But those proteins are unwieldy and difficult to purify for regular use in a vaccine. What about targeting the siderophore itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating protective vaccines that target siderophores has been considered a risky prospect since the molecules are so small and don’t seem to elicit immune responses. While a 2009 study demonstrated it was possible to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm900119q&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;generate antibodies against a siderophore&lt;/a&gt; (in this case vibriobactin), they didn’t show a protective immune response. But two papers published side-by-side in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; last year showed how researchers have accomplished targeting the mouse immune response against siderophores. One study from the Mobley lab described their continued efforts to generate a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606324113&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;vaccine against UPEC&lt;/a&gt;. Here, they conjugated the siderophores aerobactin and yersiniabactin to cationized bovine serum albumin—albumin protein modified to elicit a strong immune response—and successfully immunized mice against urinary tract infections. Unfortunately, Mobley’s group wasn’t able to demonstrate protective antibodies against the siderophores. According to the study’s first author Dr. Laura Mike, “it is possible that siderophores are stimulating the immune system in other ways; the small size of the siderophores are not as amenable to many of the standard immunological assays.” This makes it difficult to identify the type of immune response the mice were generating as a result of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the second study, from Manuela Raffatellu’s lab at the University of California, Irvine, did &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1606290113&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;detect antibodies against enterobactin&lt;/a&gt;, the siderophore of vaccination. Raffatellu’s group also conjugated the siderophore to an immunogenic protein but used cholera toxin subunit B because it helps elicit a strong mucosal response, which is important for protection against &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt;. Raffatellu’s group was also successful in generating a vaccine that protected against the pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s especially promising, according to Dr. Mike, is that these studies have shown that it may not be necessary to conjugate the siderophore to the immunogenic protein, and that these vaccines had little effect on the mice microbiomes. So, in theory, researchers could “pick any virulence-associated siderophore for a vaccine antigen. We will still have to keep in mind that not all species of bacteria, or isolates within a single species, always use the same exact siderophores,” Mike says. But this offers a way to tailor the vaccine because “we can either create very narrow-spectrum vaccines by only using one or two siderophore antigens, or we could create a broader vaccine by incorporating more siderophores into our formulation,” she adds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into anti-siderophore treatment strategies appears promising. But none of them have been translated to an effective treatment has emerged from this work, and few of the putative therapy options have been tested in mice. This is an expensive step, but is necessary to identify which of these therapies have potential for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Siderophores are small molecules that bacteria primarily use to scavenge for iron in their environment. But siderophores can do double duty, with functions in survival, attack, and signalling, making these molecules bacterial Swiss Army knives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Fig]The affinity of siderophores for iron occurs along a spectrum from high to low, and where a siderophore falls on this spectrum can alter their potential to bind other elements. In the last siderophore post, we learned that siderophores can import essential nutrients other than iron like manganese or zinc. But siderophores can also bind non-essential nutrients, as occurs with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc44437f&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;silicon-binding enterobactin&lt;/a&gt; found in the root system of a Cameroonian medicinal plant. This silicon-binding ability doesn’t seem to benefit the producing &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/em&gt; species, but likely acts as a cooperative molecule that provides the silicon its plant host requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some siderophores can also bind copper, not for growth, but for survival by decreasing toxic quantities to manageable ones. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.R111.316406&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Copper is toxic&lt;/a&gt; to bacteria, capable of killing methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; within 90 minutes (they can survive 72 hours on stainless steel). Copper binds to cellular proteins, altering their structure and thus their ability to function. And like iron, copper has redox potential so it can also undergo the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8597169&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fenton reaction&lt;/a&gt;, taking or trading electrons between Cu^1+^ and Cu^2+^ to generate hydroxyl radicals (negatively charged oxygen species like OH- or OH˙ that damage DNA).&lt;/p&gt;

      Figure 2. Enterobactin uses catechols (red) to bind iron and copper. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterobactin#/media/File:Enterobactin.svg&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yersiniabactin is one siderophore that can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jbc.org/content/290/31/18967.full.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bind copper&lt;/a&gt;, defending against both copper toxicity and reactive oxygen species. Enterobactin can also bind copper, but only after oxidation of the siderophore by the protein &lt;a href=&#34;https://jb.asm.org/content/186/17/5826.short&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CueO&lt;/a&gt;. Enterobactin binds iron using three structural features called catechol rings (circled in Fig. 2). If these rings are left unoxidized in the non-iron-bound-siderophore they can reduce copper, which worsens toxicity. By oxidizing enterobactin, CueO both helps the siderophore bind toxic copper and prevents it from becoming more toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both copper and reactive oxygen species are encountered by infection-causing bacteria within macrophages, which use those methods to kill invaders. Two siderophores that use catechol rings to bind iron, salmochelin and enterobactin, can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1042/BJ20121771&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;protect bacteria against the “oxidative burst”&lt;/a&gt;. The catch is that they must be inside the cell. The &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/em&gt; siderophore &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-014-0567-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;staphyloferrin B&lt;/a&gt; also protects against reactive oxygen species, but siderophores that lack catechols, such as yersiniabactin and aerobactin, aren’t protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;signaling&#34;&gt;Signaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, yersiniabactin appears to act as a signaling molecule with the immune response. The siderophore has been shown to help &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01397-16&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; infections spread&lt;/a&gt; and increase inflammation (which increases the production of reactive oxygen species). Other siderophores act as signals to cells of either the same or differing bacterial species. Researchers have also found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja073788v&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;boron-bound siderophores&lt;/a&gt; in seawater, where boron is quite common. Since bacteria don’t require boron and the boron-siderophore structure is different from iron-bound siderophore, the authors suggest that they function as signaling molecules instead of scavengers. Perhaps their signalling function is similar to pseudomonad &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.092016999&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pyoverdine, which helps to regulate&lt;/a&gt; its own production, as well as that of other proteins like toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

When &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt; are grown on agar together (top left), &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt; begins sporulation indicated by the expression of fluorescent proteins (bottom left). However, culturing &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;B. circulans&lt;/em&gt; (top right), doesn&amp;rsquo;t induce sporulation (bottom right). &lt;a href=&#34;http://aem.asm.org/content/83/10/e03293-16/F1.expansion.html&#34;&gt;Source, Fig. 1&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some strains of bacteria belonging to the Firmicute phylum, such as &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, form endospores. Endospores are like survival pods that enable the bacteria to survive harsh conditions. The process of endospore formation (sporulation) occurs in response to environmental signals, such as low nutrient levels. Recently, researchers have identified another one, siderophores. When &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03293-16&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; imports siderophores produced by other species (e.g., enterobactin from &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;), this triggers sporulation. Sporulation frees up resources for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; but enables long-term survival for &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;striking&#34;&gt;Striking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poaching of siderophores by non-producing bacterial species (such as enterobactin import by &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt;) is common in the microbial world. But siderophores are not always what they appear to be—and bear more than metallic gifts. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/DT/C4DT03559C&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sideromycins&lt;/a&gt; are siderophores linked to antibiotics, their import by microbial competitors inhibits protein synthesis, making siderophores the original Trojan Horse. Additionally, the pseudomonad siderophores pyochelin and pyoverdine can create hydroxyl radicals. This helps &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/em&gt; spp. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dx.doi.org/10.2217/17460913.2.4.387&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;degrade toxic molecules&lt;/a&gt; and perform other functions. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046754&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pyochelin-produced&lt;/a&gt; reactive oxygen, for instance, can be used a weapon in interspecies warfare with &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, enterobactin can also help protect &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen, siderophores are not limited to iron binding but have alternate functions that can range from cell signaling, to cooperative element scavenging, to oxidative stress protectors or even producers. Microbes even use siderophores as weapons against each other, taking advantage of their competitors’ need for iron. So are there ways to target these bacterial Swiss Army knives with antibiotic treatments and turn siderophores against their makers? Stay tuned for the final installment in the siderophore series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Part 2 in a multipart post about bacterial siderophores. Next: &lt;a href=&#34;https://alliancescc.github.io/project/siderophore_treatment_target/&#34;&gt;can humans develop treatments to exploit our knowledge of siderophores?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
